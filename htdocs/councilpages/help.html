<h3>Printing Pages</h3>
Simply print the page from your browser. The page will automatically be formatted for the printer.
<h3>PDF Documents</h3>
<p>Some documents on our web site are in Portable Document Format (PDF), and require Adobe Reader (a file viewer) in order to read the document.  If you do not have this viewer installed, you may download it for free from the Adobe website. </p>
<p> If you find yourself viewing a blank white screen after clicking on a PDF file link try using the 'refresh' or 'reload' command. (Using the browser menu go to View->Refresh/Reload, or use the icon beside the stop button on the toolbar). Alternatively, you may need to upgrade your version of Adobe Reader. </p>
<p> Some of our PDF documents are very large but they have all been web-enabled, which means that you will receive the first page of a document while the rest of it continues to download in the background. This ensures that you, the reader, have something to view while you are waiting.</p>
