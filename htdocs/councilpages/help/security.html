<h2>iPad Secure Use Gudelines - Paperless Council Project</h2>
	  <p>The  most effective security measure for the mobile devices is to follow the best  preventive practices, and requires a firm commitment from all users of mobile  technology. </p>
	  <p> All  users should follow appropriate guidelines for setting passwords on mobile  devices as well as enable the device to be remotely wiped of all data and  locked to prevent access by anyone other than IT:      </p>
	  <h3>Protect</h3>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Do not leave devices       unattended in vulnerable locations such as offices, airports, and hotels</li>
        <li>Keep out of sight when not       in use in a public place (which may include your work station)</li>
        <li>Prevent physical damage by       using standard handling procedures available on the manufacturer&rsquo;s website</li>
        <li>Recovery costs may be       incurred by &nbsp;your department ? user? if loss or damage is due to negligence on the       part of the user      </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Secure      </h3>
      <p> Set Up a Passcode:</p>
      <p> To set up or change a passcode:<br />

      <p>&nbsp;Encrypt  Data:</p>
    <p> No need to worry about security of your  data while in transfer through the Network.  iPad offers encoding hardware-based  encryption to protect all data on the device. Encryption is always enabled and cannot be disabled by users. iPad  provides encrypted protection of data in transit, at rest, or backed up to  iTunes.</p>
      <p> Locate  and Erase:</p>
      <p> If you  lose your iPad, Find My iPad can  help you locate it on a map, display a message, or remotely delete your data.  How?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sign  in to iCloud.com from any web  browser on a Mac or PC. 
          Or borrow your friend&rsquo;s iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch and use the FindMyiPad app. FindMyiPad shows you  the approximate location of your iPad on a map. </li>
        <li>Display  a message or play a sound to help you find it.</li>
        <li>If  someone finds your iPad, let them know how to find you. Write a message and  display it on your iPad screen. Something like, &ldquo;Oops, left my iPad behind.  Please call me at 408-555-0198.&rdquo; Your message appears, even if the screen is  locked. And if the map shows that your iPad is nearby &mdash; perhaps in your office  under a pile of papers &mdash; yet you still can&rsquo;t find it, you can tell FindMyiPad to  play a sound that overrides the volume or silent setting.</li>
        <li>if you  lose your iPad and displaying a message on it hasn&rsquo;t resulted in its safe  return, you can initiate a remote wipe to restore it to its factory settings <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/built-in-apps/find-my-ipad.html">http://www.apple.com/ipad/built-in-apps/find-my-ipad.html</a></li>
        <li>By  default, iPad will automatically wipe the device after 10 failed passcode  attempts.        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note: It will work only if FindMyiPad has been previously installed and enabled. How? Settings  &gt; tap iCloud &gt; enable FindMyiPad.</p>
      <p> For more information see iPad &ndash; Q&amp;A on this website.      </p>
      <h3>Be  responsible</h3>
      <p>         Be advised that if you believe that you will be using the device in an area  considered to be 'roaming', you are  expected to contact the Help Desk a few days ahead of the planned roaming usage  to have a roaming package set up for a short or long duration.&nbsp; Tablets  roaming fees</p>
      <p> Recovery costs may be incurred if roaming cost is due  to negligence on the part of the user.</p>
