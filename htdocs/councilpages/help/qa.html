<h2><a name="_Toc320696967" id="_Toc320696967">1. Where can I find a complete iPad  manual?</a></h2>
<p> You can find it online: <br />
  <a href="http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/ipad_2_user_guide.pdf">http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/ipad_2_user_guide.pdf</a></p>
<p>Note: also available in the Bookmarks <img src="images/clip_image002.jpg" alt="" width="24" height="21" border="0" /></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc320696968" id="_Toc320696968">2. How  do I access iPad support?</a> </h2>
<p>For full iPad support provided by Apple go  to:<br />
  <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/support/ipad/">http://www.apple.com/ca/support/ipad/</a></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc320696969" id="_Toc320696969"></a><a name="_Toc318469371" id="_Toc318469371">3. Is  my data secure on an iPad?</a> </h2>
<p> The most effective security measure for  the mobile devices, such as laptops, iPads, smartphones is to follow the best  preventive practices. See ‘iPad Secure Use Guidelines’ on this website.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc320696970" id="_Toc320696970"></a><a name="_Toc318469372" id="_Toc318469372">4. Will  I encounter any FOIP issues?</a> <u> </u></h2>
<p> The possibility to encounter the FOIP  issues when using an iPad is not different then when using your laptop or smartphone.  Be aware that you may be working with sensitive information and take  precautions. See ‘iPad Secure Use Guidelines’ on this website. See question# to  find out how <strong>Find My iPad</strong> can help  you locate it on a map, display a message, or remotely delete your data.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc320696971" id="_Toc320696971"></a><a name="_Toc318469373" id="_Toc318469373">5. Why  did I receive SIM card info with my iPad?</a> </h2>
<p> If you received a SIM card, it means  that you have 3G iPad model with the micro-SIM card that is used for cellular  data download. Your micro-SIM card was already pre-installed and you are on  data plan, similar to the data plan when you operate a Smartphone. There is a  monthly fee for this data plan that Saanich covers.<br />
  Your iPad will automatically switch to a  Wi-Fi network if a Wi-Fi is available in the area. </p>
<p>See page 29 of the manual: <a href="http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/ipad_2_user_guide.pdf">http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/ipad_2_user_guide.pdf</a></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc320696972" id="_Toc320696972"></a><a name="_Toc318469374" id="_Toc318469374">6. What  is the difference between WiFi and 3G iPad models?</a> </h2>
<p> The <strong>3G  enabled iPad</strong> will work in the field without the need to be connected to the  WiFi network. It requires a SIM card and a data plan, similar to data plan when  you operate a Smartphone.</p>
<p> The <strong>Wi-Fi model</strong> will only operate in  locations where free Wi-Fi signals are found. </p>
<h2><a name="_Toc320696973" id="_Toc320696973">7. I have a wireless connection at home,  how do I switch between the data plan and Wi-Fi? </a></h2>
<p>iPad will switch automatically from data  plan to wireless if Wi-Fi is on. Make sure that Wi -Fi is&nbsp;enabled on your  iPad. Choose Settings &gt; Wi-Fi and turn Wi-Fi on.  </p>
<p><img src="images/clip_image003.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="53" border="0" /></p>
<div> </div>
<p>The iPad model you use is listed as  &quot;Wi-Fi + 3G&quot;. It offers both: 1) the standard Wi-Fi connectivity 2) plus the option to sign up for 3G  cellular service with specific networks (Telus for example) and get a  connection to the Internet when Wi-Fi is unavailable.</p>
<ol>
  <li> The standard Wi-Fi connectivity <br />
    (iPad can join Wi-Fi networks at home, at work, or at Wi-Fi hotspots around the  world and there is no cost and no limit to amount of data you can download). <br />
    Make sure that Wi -Fi is&nbsp;enabled on  your iPad. Choose Settings &gt; Wi-Fi and turn Wi-Fi on.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>We already signed up your iPad for 3G cellular service /data plan.  Your micro-SIM card was already pre-installed and you are on data plan, similar  to the data plan when you operate a Smartphone. There is a monthly fee for this  data plan that Saanich covers.&nbsp;The data plan for all of our iPads is set  at $20 per month for up to 500 MB. Overage is charged at $0.05 per MB.<br />
    For most our iPad users this plan is  sufficient enough. For other users it may not be the case, depending on how  much data you need to download every day.<br />
    <br />
    &gt; Your iPad will automatically switch  to Wi-Fi network if Wi-Fi is available in the area. See page 29 of the user  manual: <a href="http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/ipad_2_user_guide.pdf">http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/ipad_2_user_guide.pdf<br />
      </a>&gt; If you decide you need to be able  to download more data, you can upgrade your data plan.<br />

<p>FaceTime is easy to set up. All you need is an Apple  ID and an email address, and you’re ready to go. To start a FaceTime call, tap  your contact’s phone number if she/he has an iPhone 4, or tap her/his email  address to call an iPad 2, iPod touch, or Mac. An invitation pops up on her  screen, and when she accepts, the call begins. See the video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWQNYwTafZo&amp;feature=relmfu">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWQNYwTafZo&amp;feature=relmfu</a></p>
<p>You can switch between the two built-in  cameras on iPad 2 anytime during a call. The front camera faces you, and the  back camera faces what’s in front of you, so you can show where you are or  share visual details from a job site.</p>

<p>AirPlay Mirroring lets you wirelessly  stream whatever’s on your iPad screen to your HDTV via Apple TV.  Setting up Apple TV is about as simple as it  gets. Just plug the power cord into the wall and connect Apple TV to your  widescreen TV using an HDMI cable (sold separately).<strong> </strong></p>
<p>1) Go to the AirPlay setting on the  Apple TV and make sure it's turned on <br />
  2)   Make sure your TV is on and set to the correct input that your Apple TV  is connected to<br />
  3) When you display a video or  presentation on your iPad, there's an icon on the iPad's playbar that looks  like a TV. Just tap it and select Apple TV and it will send it to the TV<br />
  4) If you want to mirror everything that  you do on the iPad to the TV, double tap the Home button, swipe right, and  you'll see the same icon there. Click on it, tap on Apple TV, then turn  mirroring on.</p>
