<h2>Emerging Technology Program @ Saanich</h2>

	<p>
		With mainstream availability of devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and business applications for them, many organizations have been
		successful in using mobile and personal devices to dramatically reduce their use of paper and increase productivity. From any location, these
		devices provide access to documents, easier reading of documents, convenient access to applications such as email, and highly efficient browsing
		access to the internet.
	</p>

    <p>
    	The Emerging Technology Program at Saanich is one component of a wider enterprise IT initiative to provide the organization with ability to offer a
    	broader range of end user devices, and enabling staff  to choose the type of device that fits best their work  requirements. It supports the
    	following corporate objectives:
    </p>

    <ul>
    	<li>Increasing productivity within business units</li>
    	<li>Increasing citizen, customer and staff satisfaction</li>
    	<li>Environmental sustainability (paperless job activities)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    	Emerging Technology Program is piloting the delivery of new technology into areas of the organization where it can lead <u>to productivity gains
    	beyond the pure cost of the devices</u>.
    </p>

    <h3>Projects</h3>

    <p>By 2013, it is expected that every worker will be bringing a commercial device into the workplace.</p>

    <p>
    	Risks and costs of doing nothing about personal and unmanaged devices are greater than the risks and costs of investing the time and resources to
    	develop a strategy, define processes, and apply technical controls. Consumerization is here, and organizations need to respond accordingly.
    </p>

    <p>
    	The Councilâ€™s Office projects found under the Emerging Technology program investigate the enablement of mobile devices, personal or company-owned,
    	in day-to-day business by piloting the delivery of new technology into areas of the organization where it can lead to productivity gains beyond the
    	pure cost of the devices. Placement of new devices in the hands of our employees assists SaanichIT to:
    </p>

    <ul>
    	<li>manage the explosion in mobile devices on the corporate network, while maintaining security</li>
    	<li>design adequate support processes to deliver this technology in a sustainable way</li>
    	<li>anticipate future technology requirements and expectations in the organization</li>
    	<li>validate that the deeper investments in infrastructure will support the future technology needs of Saanich</li>
    </ul>
