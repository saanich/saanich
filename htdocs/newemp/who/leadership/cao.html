		  <h2>Leadership Team </h2>
          <p> <img src="../../../images/PaulMurray_001.JPG" class="float-right" alt="Tim Wood">Paul joined the District of Saanich in 2001.&nbsp; His 25 year background in municipal leadership includes serving as Director of Finance before becoming the Chief Administrative Officer.</p>
          <p>Paul was born on the island of Guernsey, Channel Islands, and graduated from St. Sampson's Secondary School.&nbsp; He worked his way through a business degree at Simon Fraser University and a graduate degree in public administration at University of Victoria, neither which truly prepared him for the world of local government.</p>
          <p>On the volunteer side, Paul has coached soccer for many years and more recently completed a stint as President of the Government Finance Officers Association and the Director of the Local Government Management Association of BC and the Local Government Leadership Academy.</p>
          <p>To help with stress, Paul recommends always keeping in mind how lucky we are as Canadians to live our lives in such a wonderful country, compared to many others around the world.&nbsp; A good walk or bike ride doesn't hurt either.</p>
          <p>His guiding pearl of wisdom is, &ldquo;Never argue with an idiot. They bring you down to their level then beat you with experience.&rdquo;</p>
