		  <p>The provincial government sets out the ground rules governing municipalities in the Local
		    Government Act. This Act is the framework which guides the creation of local government
		    and covers all facets of its operation. The basic responsibility for local government
		    services and decisions lies with municipal councils. When Saanich was incorporated in 1906
		    a Mayor and Council was elected to determine its policies and oversee its responsibilities. </p>
          <h2> The Council</h2>
          <p>The Council is the governing body of the municipality and is responsible to see that its powers are
            used for the benefit and protection of its citizens. </p>
          <p> All the powers of Council are exercised by bylaws and resolutions. The Local Government Act states
            that these decisions can only be made at regular, or at specially convened, Council meetings where
            there is a quorum, or fixed number of Council members present. </p>
          <p> Council establishes policies for the community and adopts bylaws or resolutions based on these
            policies. It must then ensure that these policies are executed by the municipality&#8217;s
            administration in the day to day business of the community. </p>
          <h2> The Mayor</h2>
          <p> The Mayor has special powers and duties as the head and chief executive officer of Saanich. In
            addition to the required duties as a member of Council, the Mayor: </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Sees that the law for the improvement and good government of Saanich is carried out; </li>
            <li> Communicates information to Council and recommends bylaws, resolutions and measures that, in
              his opinion, may assist the peace, order and good government of Saanich in relation to the
              powers conferred on the Council by any Act; </li>
            <li> Establishes standing committees for matters he considers would be better regulated and managed
              by means of committee, and appoints members of Council to the committees; but the proceedings
              of a committee are subject to the approval of Council, except delegated executive or
              administrative proceedings; </li>
            <li> Inspects and directs the conduct municipal officers and employees, directs the management of
              municipal business and affairs. </li>
          </ul>
