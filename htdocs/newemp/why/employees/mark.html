      <p><img src="../../images/mark_boysen.jpg" alt="" class="float-right">Before coming to Saanich Mark worked as an external environmental consultant, performing environmental audits for large organizations in the oil sands, pulp mills, and DND. Describing himself as &ldquo;green at the core&rdquo;, he went into consulting because he wanted to explore the issues with respect to water, air and soil pollution, and he wanted to understand the factors involved in greening businesses and communities. In time he came to realize that when it comes to sustainability, local communities are going to make it happen.</p>
      <p>When Mark told colleagues he was taking a position in a municipal government organization, he was warned to be prepared: working in local governments is slow going, frustrating and boring. Being a very practical person, he wanted to put his energy to work in a role where he really could make a difference. The warnings were disconcerting, to say the least, but Mark hasn&rsquo;t looked back.</p>
      <p>At Saanich Mark has had the opportunity to build a sustainability program that on several fronts has placed Saanich at the leading edge. Solar panels recently installed on the roof of Gordon Head Rec Centre heat the water used for showers, reducing our carbon footprint by 20 tonnes annually. An electric car, an electric Zamboni and fleet management programs are reducing our fuel consumption and further reducing our carbon footprint. And upgrades to the fleet building are significantly reducing heating and electricity costs. While many organizations are purchasing carbon off-sets to become carbon-neutral, Saanich is the first municipality in North America to establish a carbon fund, into which the savings realized from all of these sustainability initiatives are channelled to fund future energy-saving projects. This fund builds capacity and resilience that will help us continue to make real progress in addressing the challenge of climate change.</p>
      <p>Why has Mark&rsquo;s experience been the opposite of those foreboding warnings? Because sustainability is a value here at the District of Saanich. It is supported from the top of the organization, and is integrated into everything we do. You will see it referenced throughout our strategic plan and our community plan. Mark works on projects with groups at the municipal hall, in the public works and parks departments, the recreation centres and with groups of residents living in our Saanich community. </p>
      <p>You can understand why, when asked what he loves most about working at Saanich, Mark has this to say: &ldquo;When I come to work I know I am doing something to make the world a better place. I&rsquo;m always wondering what is going to be the next unique challenge, I am always learning and I enjoy working with everyone at Saanich.&rdquo;</p>
