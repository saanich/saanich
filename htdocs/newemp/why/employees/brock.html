      <p><img src="../../images/brock_henson.jpg" class="float-right" alt="">&quot;I originally began my career as a firefighter with the Saanich Fire Department and am now the Emergency Program Officer for the District of Saanich. I became a firefighter because I was attracted to the challenge of responding to major emergencies and wanted to help people, while serving my community. </p>
      <p> Upon becoming a firefighter, I was amazed at the various and diverse opportunities that existed within in the Saanich Fire Department. After several years as a firefighter I decided to pursue a Masters Degree in Disaster and Emergency Management. As I was finishing my degree, the municipality created the position of Emergency Program Officer. I was hired into the position and have never looked back. </p>
      <p> The support I receive from the fire department and municipality is amazing. As an example, they have supported me in obtaining a Diploma in Fire Service Leadership and have sent me to an international disaster zone to participate to bring back lessons learned for our municipality, twice. The District of Saanich has supported me in the fullest to become a leader in both the fire service and emergency management. I am always proud to say I work for Saanich!&quot;</p>
