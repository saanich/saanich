		  <h2>Employee Testimonials </h2>
          <p> <img src="../../images/nicola_parfett.jpg" alt="" class="float-right"><em>&quot;I have worked in the field of GIS (Geographic Information Systems) for over 20 years, both in government and private industry.&nbsp; Before coming to Saanich in 2007, I worked for ESRI, a GIS software vendor, as Professional Services Manager and for Natural Resources Canada as a GIS Analyst.</em></p>
          <p><em>I have always been passionate about GIS and providing service to people needing answers to spatial questions.&nbsp; One of the driving forces leading my career change to Saanich was the desire to provide excellence in GIS services to the local community.&nbsp; Being very operationally driven, I appreciate that our local government environment encourages the practical application of GIS to support its daily business needs.&nbsp; This is very rewarding to me as our GIS initiatives produce tangible and clear benefits to the organization and residents of Saanich, and also to the larger GIS community.</em></p>
          <p><em>Saanich is recognized as a leader in GIS.&nbsp; Some examples of this include our award winning web GIS service; a history of partnering on initiatives with internal departments and local government neighbours; and being a sought after workplace for GIS students through mentoring in the practical application of GIS.&nbsp; We are supported in our work to promote and integrate GIS throughout and beyond Saanich and we believe very strongly in its value to the organization.</em></p>
          <p><em>I appreciate that Saanich takes an active role in supporting many charitable causes and they encourage staff well being through onsite fitness classes and activities.&nbsp; </em></p>
          <p><em>What do I value most about working at Saanich? I work with a great team where we support each other, give and receive mentoring, and strive for excellence with our GIS initiatives.&nbsp; I appreciate working with bright and dedicated co-workers where mutual respect and professional work ethics are held to a high standard.&nbsp;&nbsp; I look forward to the challenges and opportunities we are given to improve and grow our GIS.&nbsp; I am rewarded knowing that the work we do improves efficiencies across all departments and is highly utilized and valued.&quot;</em></p>
