      <h2>What is a Subdivision</h2>
      <p> <img src="/images/business/plans.jpg" class="float-left" alt="Plans" />Subdivision can generally be
        described as the legal mechanism to create new, titled parcels of land. Where a proposed
        subdivision complies with the current zoning regulations for the parcel, applications are
        submitted to the Saanich Approving Officer. </p>
      <p> Privately owned land in B.C. is registered under the Torrens land title registration system.
        Generally, land cannot be conveyed or subdivided without registering the changes in the Land Title
        Office.</p>
      <p> In almost all cases, the Land Title Office will not register new parcels that are created through
        subdivision without the signature of an Approving Officer on the plan of subdivision. </p>
      <h3 class="float-clear">Role and Authority of Approving Officer</h3>
      <p> The <em>Land Title Act</em> requires that Municipal Council appoint an Approving Officer as the
        statutory official responsible to ensure that subdivisions applications comply with provincial
        statutes, regulations and local government bylaws regulating subdivision. Provincial statutes
        establish the Approving Officers role as a quasi-judicial position whose discretion is separate
        and independent from elected officials and municipal staff. </p>

        Asked Questions </h3>

      <h2 class="float-clear">Types of Subdivision Where Approval of the Approving Officer is Required:</h2>
      <img src="/images/business/vector_plans.jpg" class="float-right" alt="Plans" />
      <ul>
        <li> Adjusting lot boundaries between two or more parcels; </li>
        <li>Creating several new lots from one or more parcels;</li>
        <li>Creating lots in a bare land strata development;</li>
        <li>Creating a phased strata plan development;</li>
        <li>Subdivision of land for the purpose of leasing for a term longer than 3 years;</li>
        <li>Air space plan subdivisions</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Municipal Council Approvals are Required for:</h2>
      <h3>Zoning &amp; Variances</h3>
      <p> Zoning is a way of regulating the use and density of land. If a property must be rezoned or
        variances are required before it can be subdivided, it will be necessary to provide rezoning
        and/or development variance permit applications concurrently with the subdivision submission.
        Review of the applications will take place simultaneously and when complete, planning staff will
        prepare a report for Council&rsquo;s consideration of the proposed rezoning and/or variances.
        For an overview of the rezoning process please refer to: <a href="pdfs/rez_guide.pdf">A Guide to Rezoning</a><img src="/images/logos/pdf.gif" alt="PDF document">. </p>
      <p> If and when Council adopts an amending bylaw or issues any required variances, the subdivision
        application would be referred to the Approving Officer, who will make a decision with respect to
        approval or rejection of the proposed subdivision. </p>
      <img src="/images/business/panhandle.jpg" class="float-right" alt="Panhandle" />
      <h3>Panhandle Lots </h3>
      <p> A panhandle lot is a
        parcel which requires a relatively narrow strip of land, or panhandle, to provide principal
        vehicle access to a street. Council policy states that &ldquo;All panhandle lots that do not
        provide a minimum frontage on a highway of 10% perimeter of the lot shall be referred to Council
        for consideration of an exemption from the statutory requirement under s. 944(2) of the <em>Local
          Government Act</em>.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> If your subdivision proposal includes one or more lots in a panhandle configuration, the
        application must be referred to Council for consideration of a request to waive the 10% perimeter
        road frontage requirement.; Please refer to the <a
                     	href="http://intranet/intranet/policies/view_one.cfm?ID=114&menuID=21">Reduced
          Frontage Council Policy</a>, which identifies the issues considered by Council when assessing
        these requests. The authority to waive the 10% perimeter road frontage requirement for <em> <strong>non-panhandle lots</strong></em> is delegated to the Approving Officer. </p>
      <h3>Strata Title Conversion of a Previously Occupied Building</h3>
      <p> If a previously occupied building is to be subdivided into strata lots, the Municipal Council is
        the &ldquo;approving authority&rdquo;.&nbsp; Section 242 of the <em>Strata Property Act</em> provides the criteria that Council must take into consideration when assessing applications. <a

          Form</a> <img src="/images/logos/pdf.gif" alt="PDF document"> </p>
      <h2>Refusal of Subdivision</h2>
      <p> The Approving Officer may decide to refuse to approve a subdivision plan under the relevant
        provisions of the Subdivision Bylaw, Zoning Bylaw, Provincial Statutes and Regulations. If a
        subdivision plan is rejected, there is no appeal to Mayor and Council. The applicant may only
        appeal an Approving Officer&rsquo;s decision to the B.C. Supreme Court under s. 89 of the <em>Land
          Title Act</em> It is important to note that only the applicant may initiate an appeal under this
        legislation. There is no appeal procedure set out in the <em>Bare Land Strata Regulations</em>. </p>
      <h2>Regulatory Framework</h2>
      <p> There is a wide range of both provincial and local government legislation and regulations taken
        into consideration when assessing a subdivision application, including, but not limited to: </p>
