      <h2>What is Adaptable Housing and why is it important?</h2>
      <p> There are two parts to Saanich's Adaptable Housing: the mandatory Basic Adaptable
        Housing, and voluntary design guidelines. </p>
      <p> Basic Adaptable Housing means that all new apartment buildings in Saanich that share
        a common corridor and elevator are required to include some modest improvements to
        accessibility and adaptability. </p>
      <p> Voluntary design guidelines have also been developed for apartments (Enhanced) and
        ground-oriented housing (Single Family and Townhouses). </p>
      <p> Adaptable Housing will make it easier to live and visit for people with physical
        limitations. This initiative supports Saanich's goal toward building healthy
        communities. </p>
      <h2> Will adaptable apartments have an institutional look that is sometimes associated
        with housing for the disabled? </h2>
      <p> No. Adaptable Housing features are subtle, and differences will not be apparent. Most
        adaptable features are &quot;invisible&quot;. For example, grab bars are not
        required, but blocking in the bathroom will provide reinforcement for grab bars if
        they are needed in the future. Light switches, electrical outlets and lever door
        handles can be accessible without looking clinical. This means that housing can
        appeal to everyone, and marketability can be enhanced. </p>
      <h2>Why not just allocate a certain percentage of units as &quot;accessible&quot;? <br />
        Doesn't this make sense since most of us aren't disabled? </h2>
      <p> The traditional approach to accessibility in residential buildings has been to
        allocate a percentage of units as &quot;wheelchair accessible&quot;. There are a
        number of disadvantages to this approach: it leads to separate facilities for people
        with disabilities which can be isolating. In addition, owners often find
        &quot;accessible units&quot; hard to sell or rent because of their clinical,
        institutional look. Also, reverse renovations to remove accessible features are
        expensive. </p>
      <p> The trend is toward adaptable design. Saanich requires a basic level of adaptable
        design that allows someone using a wheelchair or other mobility aid to visit or live
        in a suite without encountering significant barriers. Adaptable design allows
        features to be hidden or invisible until they are needed. </p>
      <h2>How much does this cost?</h2>
      <p> The mandatory Basic Adaptable Housing features result in improvements in
        accessibility for a relatively modest cost. The cost is expected to be under $1,000
        per dwelling unit. </p>
      <p> Developers often comment that small additional costs incrementally add to the cost
        of housing and eventually impact affordability.&nbsp; While this is indeed true,
        Adaptable Housing also increases the value and functionality that will last the
        lifetime of a building. It will broaden the client base for a development, and
        provide a long term return on the investment. </p>
      <p> Another point to consider is the cost of renovations for people who face mobility
        problems from aging, illness or injury.&nbsp; Minor renovations and alterations to
        standard dwellings can cost thousands of dollars. These costs can be avoided, or
        greatly reduced, if basic adaptability features are incorporated at the design stage.
        There is also the untold cost of relocation, both financial and social/emotional. In
        addition, renters who use walkers or wheelchairs report that they often lose their
        damage deposits because of inadvertent damage to doorways and mouldings resulting
        from insufficient manoeuvring room. </p>
      <p> North Vancouver recently completed an evaluation of several years of their adaptable
        design requirements that showed there has been no negative impact on pricing,
        selling, or construction. The development and real estate industries have come
        solidly behind the program. </p>
