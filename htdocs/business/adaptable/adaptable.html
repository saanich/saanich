      <p>Adaptable Housing requirements are modest improvements
        to accessibility and adaptability in residential buildings
        that make it easier for people to &quot;remain in place&quot;
        as they age, and experience illness or injury.</p>
      <p>Saanich's Adaptable Housing is based on the principle of
        &quot;visitability&quot;.&nbsp; This means that people's
        homes should be accessible to everyone, not just able-bodied
        people.&nbsp; It eases problems associated with isolation,
        and allows people with physical limitations to visit friends
        and neighbours, and stay in communities where they have
        developed social ties.</p>
      <p>Forecasts in demographics predict that Saanich's population
        is aging.&nbsp; In 30 years, the proportion of seniors over
        the age of 65 will double and make up almost one-third of
        the population.&nbsp; Increasing the stock of seniors-friendly
        housing is important for the social well-being of the community
        and the quality of life of Saanich's residents.</p>
      <p>Adaptable Housing features follow &quot;universal design&quot;
        principles, meaning that the housing can appeal to everyone.&nbsp;
        Adaptable Housing features are visually unnoticeable, and
        allow increased flexibility in selling or renting homes.&nbsp;
        Including these features at the design stage is inexpensive
        and greatly reduces the cost of renovation in the future.</p>

      <h2>Adaptable Housing- Mandatory and Voluntary </h2>
      <p>In November 2003, Saanich Council
        passed an amendment to the Zoning Bylaw that requires
        most newly-constructed apartment buildings and seniors'
        congregate care facilities be built to include Basic
        Adaptable Housing standards.&nbsp; Building permits
        issued for <strong>apartment buildings </strong>with
        an elevator and common corridor must comply with the
        new regulations.</p>
      <p>Those applying for rezoning, subdivision and development
        permit applications are also encouraged to incorporate
        features from the voluntary design guidelines for
        apartment buildings, townhouses, and single-family
        homes.      </p>
      <h2 class="float-clear">Basic Adaptable Housing</h2>
      <p>The mandatory <a href="pdf/mand_bldg.pdf">Basic Adaptable
        Housing</a><img src="/images/logos/pdf.gif" alt="PDF document"> features include barrier-free access to
        all suites and amenity areas, wider doorways, manoeuvring
        room at suite entries and corridors, access to a main-floor
        bathroom, reinforcement of bathroom walls for future installation
        of grab bars, and accessible door handles, switches, and
        outlets.      </p>
      <p><img src="/images/living/adaptable/autodoor.jpg" class="float-left" alt="automatic door" /> <img src="/images/living/adaptable/doorhandle.jpg" class="float-left" alt="door handle" /> <img src="/images/living/adaptable/pocketdoor.jpg" class="float-left" alt="pocket door" /> Basic Adaptable Housing is required for newly-constructed
            residential buildings serviced by an elevator containing
      apartment or congregate housing uses.      </p>
      <h2 class="float-clear"><img src="/images/living/adaptable/kitchen.jpg" class="float-left" alt="kitchen" />Enhanced Adaptable Housing</h2>
      <p>The voluntary <a href="pdf/vol_guidelines.pdf">Enhanced
            Adapatable Housing Design Guidelines</a><img src="/images/logos/pdf.gif" alt="PDF document"> apply
            to apartment buildings.&nbsp; They provide a higher
            level of accessible and adaptable features than Basic
            Adaptable and are appropriate, for example, for seniors
            housing.&nbsp; Those applying for rezoning and development
            permit applications for apartment buildings are encouraged
      to incorporate as many of these features as possible.      </p>
      <h2 class="float-clear"><img src="/images/living/adaptable/pinkhouse.jpg" class="float-left" alt="adaptable housing" />Single Family and Townhouse
      Adaptable Housing</h2>
      <p>Accessibility and adaptability
            are also important for ground-oriented housing.&nbsp;
            The intent is to provide the flexibility to enable
            an occupant to live on the ground floor if necessary,
            and to improve general accessibility into and throughout
      the dwelling unit.</p>
      <p class="float-clear"><img src="/images/living/adaptable/nostep_entry.jpg" class="float-left" alt="no step entry" />A no-step entry can usually be incorporated without
            a ramp by grading the walkway to the front door.&nbsp;
            Builders undertaking subdivisions and construction
            projects are encouraged to incorporate the voluntary <a href="pdf/vol_guidelines.pdf">Single Family
      and Townhouse Adaptable Housing Design Guidelines</a><img src="/images/logos/pdf.gif" alt="PDF document"> into their developments.</p>
