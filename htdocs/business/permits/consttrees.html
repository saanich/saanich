      <p>The <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/parkrec/parks/trees/bylaw.html">Tree Bylaw</a> regulates the cutting of trees in two primary classifications depending on whether the subject property is Rural or Urban. Properties within the Urban Containment Boundary are considered Urban.</p>
      <h2>Is it Rural Property?</h2>
      <p>If Rural - the property owner is allowed to remove 3 trees each calendar year for each full acre of property. The bylaw does allow tree removals on Agricultural Land Reserve land for legitimate agricultural purposes by affidavit.&nbsp; A tree on rural land is defined as any species either taller than 5 m (16.4 ft) or having a Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) larger than 10 cm (3.9 in).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the tree damaging activities clause 9(a) does not apply to rural properties but we encourage protection technique
        <li>other considerations on rural property: is the tree on a floodplain, is the tree within 30 m (98.5 ft) of a watercourse (even if it is ephemeral) on a property in DP Area #24,Tod Creek/Prospect Lake. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Is it Urban Property?</h2>
      <p><strong>Are there protected trees?</strong> This includes Garry Oak, Arbutus, Pacific Dogwood and Pacific Yew greater than 10 cm or Douglas Fir and Western Cedar greater than 60 cm DBH (24 inches) or any other trees over 80 cm DBH (31.5 in)?<br>
      The bylaws prohibit the removal or damage or pruning of Garry Oak, Arbutus, Pacific Dogwood and Pacific Yew over 5 m (16.3 ft) in height or 10 cm (3.9 in) or more in diameter, Douglas Fir and Western Red Cedar over 60 cm (24 in) in diameter, any other trees over 80 cm (31.5 in) in diameter and Saanich significant trees.</p>
      <h2>How to measure</h2>
      <p>      The diameter of a tree is measured 1.4 m (4.5 ft) above the ground.&nbsp; It can be determined by dividing the circumference by 3.142.&nbsp; The Protected Root Zone (PRZ) is the radius distance of 18 x diameter from the trunk.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/parkrec/parks/trees/bylaw.html">Tree Bylaw</a> prohibits the removal of protected trees from urban land with potential for residential development.&nbsp; If a property can be subdivided into two or more lots without rezoning, it is Urban Land.&nbsp; Tree bylaw protected trees are protected wherever they are located on Urban Land.</p>
      <h2>Is this land designated as a Development Permit Area?</h2>
      <p>      Prohibits the removal of any tree growing on any land designated as a Development Permit Area. This includes DP Area #25 South Wilkinson Valley.&nbsp; Two replacement trees are required for each tree removed within DP Area #25.</p>
      <h2>Are there any trees currently marked on the plan as "to be retained"?</h2>
      <p>      Prohibits the removal of any tree shown as "to be retained" on a plan attached to a development permit.</p>
      <h2>Is there a watercourse on the property?<br>
      Are there any trees within 15 m of the natural boundary of the watercourse?</h2>
<p>        Prohibits the removal of any tree, rural or urban, growing within 15 m (49 ft) of the natural boundary of a stream as shown on Schedule B to the Watercourse and Drainage Bylaw #7501 or on a floodplain.</p>
      <h2>Are there any designated Saanich Significant Trees on the property?</h2>
      <p>      Prohibits the removal of trees designated Saanich Significant trees located anywhere on the property or boulevard.</p>
      <h2>Is there a steep slope on the property?<br>
      Are there any trees on the steep slope that will be removed?</h2>
<p>        If you wish to remove more than two trees per year or remove stumps and roots from the ground, the Corporation of the District of Saanich requires a report prepared by a qualified Geotechnical Engineer.&nbsp; The report, which is to be prepared at the applicant's expense, must state that the proposed tree removals or removal of the stump(s) and roots will not create a danger from flooding, erosion, landslip or avalanche.</p>
      <h2>Exemption</h2>
      <p>      The bylaw protects trees of the previously described species and size when they are located outside of an Urban Lot's building envelope when the lot is less than 1,500 sq m (16,146 sq ft) in area.&nbsp; This means that all <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/parkrec/parks/trees/bylaw.html">Tree Bylaw</a> "protected trees" within the building envelope are not protected on these small lots and may be removed.</p>
      <p>If the Urban Lot is larger than 1,500 sq m (16,146 sq ft) in area and the trees are in the building envelope the trees are not protected if the purpose of their removal is to construct a building or addition to a building.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Please note:&nbsp; The Parks Department will not process an application for removal of trees in this category until there is a Building Permit application.</strong></em><br>
      <em><strong>Requirements for Tree Permit Applications for Construction/Development</strong></em></p>
