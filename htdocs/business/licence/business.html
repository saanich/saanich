      <h2>General Information </h2>
      <p>The<a href="http://saanich.ca/living/pdf/buslicence8213.pdf"> Business Licence Bylaw</a> requires that all businesses operating in Saanich be in
        possession of a valid Saanich Business Licence or a valid Intermunicipal Business Licence.
        This requirement applies to all commercial, industrial, home based and non-resident businesses
        operating within the municipality. </p>
      <p>Complete the <a href="documents/2011APPLICATIONFORM.pdf">Business Licence Application Form</a> and remit to the address, fax, or email address below. Business Licence application forms are also available at the Saanich Municipal Hall. If you are applying for a home-based licence, please read the <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/business/licence/home.html">requirements</a> first. </p>
      <p>A Business Licence application takes approximately 10 business days to process, as a number of depatments (planning, inspections, fire) must review an application before a business licence can be issued. The Capital Reginal District, and Provincial and Federal governments may also have additional requirements that must be met before a business can legally operate.</p>
      <p>Approval is required when the use of a business premise is changed, a property is developed, or building additions are undertaken, in order to ensure compliance with bylaws and regulations. </p>
      <h2>Changes to your Business Licence</h2>
      <p>If you have a <strong>change of address, change of name, </strong>or <strong>change of ownership</strong>, please fill out the Business Licence Application Form (above) with the new changes.</p>
      <p>If you receive a Business Licence Renewal Invoice but your business has <strong>ceased to operate</strong>, please sign and return the invoice, stating &quot;CLOSED&quot;, or contact the District of Saanich at 250-475-5401. </p>
      <h2>Annual Fees</h2>
      <p> Fees for each business category are set out below.  For business commencing operation after
        July 31, the fees are reduced by 50%. </p>
