        Bicycle Touring Route</a><img src="/images/logos/pdf.gif" alt="PDF document" width="19" height="16"> circumnavigates
        the Municipality of Saanich. Wherever possible, it follows

        rural or residential roads. The eastern section offers
        spectacular ocean views; the northern section passes Elk
        and Prospect Lakes, both with excellent swimming and picnic
        facilities; to the west are rural undeveloped forested
        areas and farms; the southern section follows the Galloping
        Goose trail which overlooks the Portage Inlet.</p>
      <p>The total circle route is approximately 45 km, but cyclists
        preferring a shorter route may follow a smaller loop by taking
        any of the many other bicycle routes within Saanich.&nbsp;Bicycle
        symbols on a bright yellow back-ground clearly mark the route
        direction as it passes through Saanich.</p>

Mount Douglas summit, accessible via a paved, but steep, park
                     road, is the highest point within Saanich.&nbsp; The lookout
                     provides a 360<sup>o</sup> view over-looking downtown Victoria
                     and the Olympic Mountains to the south, the San Juan Islands
                     and Mt. Baker to the east and the North Shore Mountains behind
                     Vancouver to the north.&nbsp;Mount Douglas Park beach
                     is a long sandy beach.&nbsp;
                     </p>
                     <p><a href="http://www.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/index.html">Dominion
                       Astrophysical Observatory</a> offers panoramic views of
                       southern Vancouver Island and also an opportunity to visit
      the telescope. It is a steady 5-6% climb to the summit.&nbsp;</p>
                     <p>Hartland Mountain Bike Park is accessed via Hartland Road
                       in the Saanich northwest corner.&nbsp; Detailed information
                       and maps for this superb mountain bike park are available
                       at most bike shops.</p>
                     <p>The Seaside Touring Route offers spectacular ocean vistas
                       all along the eastern section of the route. Watch for Saanich
                       Park's beach access signs that often mark secluded coves
                       and beaches. Especially look for&nbsp;Cadboro-Gyro Park Beach
                       in Cadboro Bay, Hollydene Park and Arbutus Cove.&nbsp;</p>
                     <p>A short scenic side loop through Glencoe Cove-Kwatsech Park
                       overlooks Glencoe Cove with an unobstructed panorama of Haro
                       Straits and the San Juan Islands. If you venture into the
                       park, please walk your bike and stay on the trail, many rare,
                       protected plants grow here.</p>

                       route are the University of Victoria and Mt. Tolmie lookout,
                       possibly the best view of the entire Greater Victoria region.
                       Mt Tolmie has annually won first place for best location
                       in the region to &ldquo;take-in a scenic vista&rdquo; of
                       the greater Victoria area as voted by readers of community
