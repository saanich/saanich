      <p>The arts are part of all our lives and around us everywhere. Civic
        leaders understand the importance of creating a sense of place
        in the urban environment, and how citizens interact with that
        space. In 2001, Saanich Municipal Council approved a
        Comprehensive Arts Policy to show its support for the arts,
        to provide policy direction, and to consolidate all
        arts-related policies together.</p>
      <h2>The Vision</h2>
      <p>Saanich as a lively and creative community
        accessible to artists, to a broad range of artistic expression
        and to the participation
        of all its residents. </p>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>Encourage, promote, and support the arts and artists, municipally
        and regionally for the benefit and opportunity of all Saanich
        residents. </p>
      <h2>Arts Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Development of community spirit.</li>
        <li>Individual growth through access to the arts.</li>
        <li>Public awareness of local and regional artistic talent.</li>
        <li>Education, participation, and enjoyment of the arts, locally
          and regionally.</li>
        <li>Recognition and promotion of excellence and diversity
          within the artistic community.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Arts Policies</h2>
      <p>Saanich residents benefit from both municipal and regional
        arts.</p>
      <p>The ongoing participation of municipalities within Greater
        Victoria is crucial to the success of a coordinated regional
        arts program and strategy. Saanich seeks to provide
        funding and support for individuals and groups through close
        working relationships with the CRD, other municipalities,
        school districts, Chambers of Commerce, Tourism Victoria,
        and other agencies.</p>
      <p>Access to and participation in the arts is integral to a healthy
        community, and starts at the municipal level. Saanich
        seeks to create artistic opportunities for all Saanich citizens
        through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recreation planning</li>
        <li>Parks programming</li>
        <li>Garden art</li>
        <li>Venue establishment for performances and events (theatres
          and park space)</li>
        <li>Annual events</li>
        <li>Arts inventory and maintenance</li>
        <li>Neighbourhood Development Grants and Matching Grants</li>
        <li>Public art</li>
        <li>Incorporation of artistic elements and high quality design
          in new developments.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How</h2>
      <p><em>        Encourage private enterprise to integrate Public Art into developments with significant public areas or developments which are in areas designed for or intended to be used by the public. Providing a cash donation for Civic Public Art is an Alternative.</em></p>
      <p>Through the development application process, applicants will be informed of the District's Public Art Program.</p>
      <p>As an incentive to encourage public art on private developments, and if a developer requests it, the Municipality offers a jury process to individual projects that contain a public art component.</p>
      <p>As well, a plaque inscription program will recognize cash donations.</p>

      <h2 name="public"><a name="public" id="public"></a>Public Art</h2>
Public art is an important aspect of public
                        spaces, yielding social, physical and economic benefits. Saanich
                        has made a financial commitment to the promotion of public
                        art
                        in the community by adopting the following policy:
<h3>Allocate</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1% of the value of the capital budgets for above ground
    projects towards the purchase or commission and maintenance
    of public art to be integrated into or displayed in public
    areas; and</li>
  <li>1% of the budget for municipal building construction/renovation
    projects, or park redevelopment, in excess of $250,000
    to the purchase or commission of public art for that building,
    structure or park.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Support for Arts in Schools</h2>
Saanich and local School Districts 61 and 63 have long been
                        partnering on projects.
<p>Examples include: the Art 2000 Millennium Mural Project,
  Totally Teen Talent, and Saanich Family Christmas.</p>
<h2> Views to CRD Public Art</h2>
A new website called <a href="http://www.landmarkspublicart.ca/">LandMarks - Public Art</a> in
                      the Capital Regional District, documents Art Work that is guided
                      by public policy andplaced in a public space within Municipalities of the Capital Region. The Landmarks website is a cooperative effort of the municipalities who support he Arts Development Service of the Capital Regional District. The site displays public art that exists within four municipalities that have public art or "Percent for Art" policies
                      in place.
                      <h2> Private Sector Public Art</h2>
The vast majority of the urban
                        environment lies within the private sector. As a result, architecture and public
                        space are dependent on private developers taking an interest
                        in good urban design and in art. Good urban design contributes
                        to public enjoyment, and art can enhance that enjoyment. Art
                        on urban land, whether incorporated into the architecture
                        of a building, as a stand-alone piece or landscaping, contributes
                        to public pleasure and enjoyment. Business owners know
                        it is in their best interests to make their site aesthetically
                        pleasing - it brings customers in. Good overall design
                        costs money, bad overall design costs more money.
<p>Public art in urban public spaces is one aspect of incorporating
  art into creative urban design. Art challenges, inspires,
  and incites the beholder.</p>
