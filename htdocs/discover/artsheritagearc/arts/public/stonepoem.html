      <p><a href="stone_brochure.pdf"><img src="../../../../images/discover/arts/public/stone_brochure.jpg" class="float-right" alt="Stone Poem for Rutledge Brochure"></a>The District of Saanich in conjunction with the local community association and area residents completed the re-development and expansion of Rutledge Park in 2004. The final component of this park initiative was the selection and installation of a piece of public art. In early 2005 a Public Art Competition was held. The Rutledge Park Public Art Jury composed of three local artists, a representative from the local neighbourhood association, and a staff member from the Parks and Recreation Department, determined that the proposed work of art for this competition should address the broad theme of &ldquo;Sense of Our Place&rdquo;. The competition theme required artists to explore the connections we have with place, with specific reference to Rutledge Park and the neighbourhood.</p>
      <p>The artist selected for the project was Tina Farmilo, an interdisciplinary artist whose work is rooted in issues of community, place, and history. Tina loves storytelling of every kind, and has a career as an artist, writer, educator and community animateur. Her home is in the southern Gulf Islands.</p>
      <p>Tina created her <em><strong>&ldquo;Stone Poem for Rutledge&rdquo;</strong></em> by collecting stories, memories and history of the neighbourhood through formal research, and conversations with current and former residents and elders. From this information, Tina created poetry to reflect the history of the neighbourhood. The poems were then carved onto eight granite stones from a local quarry. The eight stone poems have been sited throughout the park to subtly enrich the beauty and meaning of this place.</p>
