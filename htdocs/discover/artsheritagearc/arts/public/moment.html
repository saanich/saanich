      <p><a href="moment_brochure.pdf"><img src="../../../../images/discover/arts/public/moment_brochure.jpg" class="float-right" alt="In The Moment Brochure"></a>The District of Saanich completed a re-development and expansion of the Gordon Head Recreation Centre in February 2010. Upgrades were made to the weight room and change rooms and an addition of a dance studio and multipurpose. The renovation included energy efficiency improvements with the installation of a green roof and a solar water heating system. Another component of this initiative was the selection and installation of a work of public art. A Public Art Competition was held and Fran Baskerville&rsquo;s artwork was the winning submission, chosen through a jury process. The Jury comprised of three local artists, a representative from the local neighbourhood association, and a Saanich Parks &amp; Recreation staff member. The chosen work of art addresses the broad theme of &ldquo;Multi-culturalism &amp; Community&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>Fran Baskerville&rsquo;s art work, <em><strong>&ldquo;In the Moment&rdquo;</strong></em>, is a glimpse of Gordon Head; a community of people sharing a landscape and home where distinct ethnic backgrounds, ages, abilities and activity choices are valued and supported.</p>
      <p>The original artwork was digitally scanned for printing on to a 10% open window covering fabric by SunGlow Window Coverings. The art work on the window coverings provides a colourful sunshade. The shade material allows some light penetration that further illuminates the artwork. Installation of the work was complete in August 2010.</p>
