      <p><a href="rings_brochure.pdf"><img src="../../../../images/discover/arts/public/rings_brochure.jpg" class="float-right" alt="Rings Brochure"></a>The District of Saanich believes public art to be important for creating a sense of place as well as a means to celebrate the centennial year. Accordingly, in 2005 a citizen jury was called together composed of three local artists, three neighbourhood association representatives and one Parks Department staff member, to oversee the selection of a piece of public art for the Centennial Trail. Artists were asked to submit a proposal that addressed the broad themes of &ldquo;Family&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;Celebrating 100 Years of Saanich&rdquo;. Over twenty artists submitted applications, from which Tyler Hodgins&rsquo;s proposal &ldquo;Rings&rdquo; was selected. Tyler Hodgins is a local artist whose work is primarily sculptural, and includes video, photography, installations and public art. His art work has been exhibited in Calgary, Vancouver and Victoria, and is held in both private and public collections across Canada and the United States. Tyler makes his home in Victoria with his wife and three children.      </p>
      <p>The placement of the sculpture at ground level achieves the effect of making it approachable for those passing by. Viewers can gaze at or through, touch and even sit in this sculptural representation of time.</p>
      <p>In forming the artwork out of steel, the artist wanted to create a contrast for the viewer between the natural setting of the artwork, and the industrial business in the immediate area. The surrounding farming activity in the valley also provides context for the art work. In reference to Saanich&rsquo;s agrarian past, the steel rings have left their mark on the concrete base the art work sits on, as the blades of farmer&rsquo;s tools would mark the earth.</p>
      <p>The changing shadows cast from the piece also mark and record the passing of time.</p>
