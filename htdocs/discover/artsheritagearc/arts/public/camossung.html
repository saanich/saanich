      <p><a href="camossung_brochure.pdf"><img src="../../../../images/discover/arts/public/camo_brochure.jpg" class="float-right" alt="Camossung Brochure"></a>The District of Saanich, in consultation with area residents, completed the re-development and expansion of the Gorge Waterway Park in 2004. One component of this park initiative is the selection and installation of a work of public art. A Public Art Competition was held starting in the spring of 2009. The Gorge Waterway Park Public Art Jury who reviewed all submissions was composed of three local artists, a representative from the local neighbourhood association, and a Saanich Parks &amp; Recreation staff member. The chosen work of addresses the broad theme of &ldquo;Knowledge of place; understanding the natural and cultural community along the Gorge waterway&rdquo;. </p>
      <p>The work of public art, <em><strong>&ldquo;Camossung&rdquo;</strong></em>, installed at Gorge Waterway Park is an appropriate story to be told in this location reflecting the history of the First Nations People who first inhabited the area and as a display of one of Saanich&rsquo;s goals; to be a steward in the protection of the natural environment.</p>
      <p>An ancient Songhees story tells of a young girl named Camossung, turned to stone by &lsquo;Hayls&rsquo; the Transformer. Camossung is believed to have spirit powers and is associated with protecting the local food resources (Coho Salmon, Herring, Oysters and Ducks) of the Songhees people. The sculpture symbolizes the significance of this location. A unique place, where fresh and salt-water merge with each ebb and flow of the Gorge Waterway. A place where animals thrive, and historically, people sought food and a spiritual connection.</p>
      <p> The original sacred stone is located below the southern side of the Tillicum Bridge, viewable beneath the water at low tide. 
        The Songhees people have participated in this project in good faith and co-operation.</p>
