      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>As the owner of a Designated Heritage or Heritage Covenanted house in the Municipality of Saanich, you may be
        eligible for assistance with the cost of preserving and/or rehabilitating the exterior of your 
        house. This would also apply to a designated interior feature. House grant availability is contingent upon the Saanich Heritage Foundation (SHF) receiving its annual funding from the Municipality of Saanich. The House Grant Program is administered by the SHF on the Municipality's behalf.</p>
      <p>Grants are based on a maximum of 35% of project costs to a maximum of $10,000 per year per designated house. These grants are subject to SHF priorities and the funding received from the Municipality. </p>
      <h2>Heritage Grant Funding Policy</h2>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li> Funding is available in the form of grants for the restoration and upkeep of heritage <strong>designated</strong> structures. </li>
        <li>Funding awards are at the discretion of the Saanich Heritage Foundation committee.</li>
        <li>Funding is determined on a case by case basis.</li>
        <li> Decisions regarding funding awards are based on priority requirements (ie. roof and
          foundation before gutters and paint), condition of heritage structure, value to the
          community, long-term viability and visibility factor. </li>
        <li>Decisions regarding funding awards are subject to available funds.</li>
        <li> As a grant recipient, photographs of your project may be published as examples of
          successfully completed retorations. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <strong>NOTE:  The Policy and the  Restoration Guidelines set out the types
        of restoration projects eligible for a Heritage Grant.  Owners are free to carry out other
        types of restoration projects at their own expense.  Owners may not, however, alter the
        exterior of a building, make a structural change to a building, or construct an addition to a
        building, without a Heritage Alteration Permit.</strong> </p>
      <h2>Eligibility</h2>
      <p> As a homeowner, you may be eligible to receive a grant if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your house or outbuilding was originally built as a single family or duplex residence and <strong>REMAINS SO</strong>; </li>
        <li>Your house or outbuilding has received Heritage Designation by the Municipality of Saanich;</li>
        <li>Your house or outbuilding is used for residential occupancy;</li>
        <li>Your house or outbuilding is covered by adequate Homeowner and General Liability insurance;</li>
        <li>Your property taxes are not in arrears;</li>
        <li>The homeowner is not involved in any ongoing or pending zoning or bylaw infractions; and</li>
        <li>The Heritage Designation plaque is prominently displayed on the exterior of your house. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Application Process</h2>
      <h3>When to Apply</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You may request an application form for a grant starting June 1st of each year. The application form and all supporting documents must be received by the Saanich Heritage Foundation (SHF) no later than <strong>DECEMBER 31st.</strong></li>
        <li>Owners are restricted to <strong>ONE</strong> application per fiscal year per property; however, the application may contain more than one project subject to the Grant limitations of a total of $10,000 for any given year.</li>
        <li>Funds are available for a <strong>one year period</strong> from the date the grant was approved.&nbsp; Any unspent funds after the <strong>one year period</strong> will be removed from the applicant's allocation unless an extension of time has been requested in writing and has been approved in advance by the SHF Board. </li>
        <li>All applications shall receive careful consideration but may not necessarily be funded.</li>
        <li>No application shall be considered to form a contractual or other obligation on the part of the SHF.</li>
        <li>Incomplete or late applications will not be reviewed. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How to Apply</h3>
      <p> You must submit to the Saanich Heritage Foundation by December 31st the following documentation: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A completed&nbsp; <a href="/living/pdf/house-grant-application.pdf"> House Grant Application Form</a>.&nbsp; Note: Incomplete applications will not be considered or reviewed. Withdrawn applications will have to be resubmitted within established guidelines.</li>
        <li>A written description of structural or restoration work.</li>
        <li>A minimum or two (2) competitive estimates. Include completed <a href="pdf/estimate.pdf"><strong>Estimate Sheets</strong></a>.</li>
        <li>Owners' labour is not eligible for funding.&nbsp; Qualified owners who do their own work via the grant process will only be reimbursed for a maximum of 35% of the cost of materials. This percentage will be the same as given to the other grant applicants&nbsp; for that year with NO EXCEPTIONS.</li>
        <li>Photos or drawings for replacement elements (i.e.) stairs, porches, balustrades, etc.</li>
        <li>Current photographs of your house <strong>before </strong>the work starts. This should show several views of the necessary work to be done. See <a href="photograph.html"><strong>Photographs Guidelines</strong></a> for details.</li>
        <li>A color scheme and color chips for applications for painting. See <a href="colour.html"><strong>Color Scheme Guidelines</strong></a> for details.</li>
        <li>Relevant archival photographs and historical documentation if available. We can make copies and return the originals to you if you so desire. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please be clear and concise. If you are unfamiliar with the process of obtaining estimates from contractors, estimate sheets and examples are available in the Guidelines. If you are in doubt, please contact our Secretary at (250) 475-1775, extension 3513 or via email at <a href="mailto:shirley.leggett@saanich.ca">Shirley.Leggett@saanich.ca.</a></p>
      <p>To submit your application, contact the SHF Secretary to arrange to deliver same to the SHF office, or mail the application to the Saanich Heritage Foundation, c/o the Legislative Division, Saanich Municipal Hall, 770 Vernon Avenue, Victoria, BC&nbsp; V8X 2W7. </p>
      <h2>Special Funding for Emergency Repairs</h2>
      <p>Applications for up to $500 for emergency repairs are reviewed on an individual basis at any time.&nbsp; However, no work is to be done prior to review and approval, and must include appropriate documentation indicating the scope of the work and estimated cost. </p>
      <h2>SHF Priorities for Funding</h2>
      <p> Due to funding limitations, the SHF considers funding projects in the following order and with a view to an overall rehabilitation plan with the first application for a grant.&nbsp; This allows the SHF to anticipate future outlays of funds: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Structural work, foundations, perimeter and storm drains, chimneys and masonry work, fascias, gutters and downspouts, and roofs;</li>
        <li>Exterior rehabilitation and  repairs, recreating the building's heritage character such as exterior fabric, woodworking and trim, stucco, windows and doors (See note in Guidelines regarding storm window priority);</li>
        <li>Exterior preparation and painting;</li>
        <li>Historically accurate and documented fences, gates and outbuildings; and </li>
        <li>Rehabilitation of designated interior features. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>(Note:&nbsp; Work deemed routine maintenance will not be funded nor will service contracts.)</strong></p>
      <h2>Grant Application Review Process</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>During January and February all completed applications and the accompanying documentation are carefully reviewed by the SHF House Grants Committee.</li>
        <li>The SHF will assign one of its members to act as a volunteer to review the proposed project as well as to&nbsp; consult with the owners or acting agent during the process. A  review of the work will also occur upon completion of the project.</li>
        <li>Final approval is usually given to grant applications in May, after SHF receives confirmation of its funding from the Municipality of Saanich. You will be notified in writing if a grant application for your project has been approved or declined.</li>
        <li><strong>Please Note:</strong> Once projects are approved, unauthorized changes are neither accepted nor funded.&nbsp; If for some reason you decide to change contractors, you must contact the SHF House Grants Committee prior to commencing work, otherwise, it could jeopardize your grant funding.</li>
        <li>Any questions with respect to the status of your application should be directed to our Secretary, Shirley Leggett, at 250- 475-1775, extension 3513, or by email, at <a href="mailto:shirley.leggett@saanich.ca">Shirley.Leggett@saanich.ca.</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Commencement of Work</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No work should commence before being <strong>notified in writing</strong> that your grant has been approved. If you wish to proceed ahead of such approval, it must be after the SHF has reviewed and discussed the proposed project along with your volunteer committee member. <strong>If you proceed with the work it is at your own risk, as the grant may not be funded.</strong></li>
        <li>Unless special dispensation is given to delay work, it should commence as soon as possible or the grant offer may be withdrawn.</li>
        <li>A site review must be done before and upon completion of all work. Preparations and repairs must be reviewed by the SHF Grant Committee member prior to painting or further work that might cover it.&nbsp; Contact numbers for the Grant Committee members will be provided.</li>
        <li>Owners are responsible to keep the assigned House Grant Committee member informed of the work process to ensure ongoing review.&nbsp; <strong>If you fail to do so, funding may be refused.</strong></li>
        <li>Please Note:&nbsp; Do not confuse SHF Grant Committee members with Saanich Municipal Building Inspectors. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Building Permits</h2>
      <p>The Municipality of Saanich requires a building permit for most construction, alterations, additions, deconstruction or demolition.&nbsp; For more information on&nbsp; building permits, call the Permits Division at Saanich Municipal Hall at (250) 475-1775, Extension 5457.</p>
      <p>Any exterior change to a Designated Heritage or Heritage Covenanted structure requires review by the Saanich Heritage Foundation and approval by Municipal Council. Please contact the Saanich Heritage Planner, Jane Evans, at (250) 475-1775, extension 3401, for further information.&nbsp; If it is determined that you will require a permit, you will also be required to arrange for an inspection by a Saanich Building Inspector. </p>
      <h2>What to do Upon Completion of Work</h2>
      <p> Upon completion of an approved project, the SHF must receive the  following  before
        the grant funds can be released:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> The SHF House Grants Committee member's final report indicating work is completed according to the SHF standards.</li>
        <li>Evidence of full payment to the contractor. All receipts to be marked PAID, signed and dated by the contractor.&nbsp; (Cancelled cheques and/or unpaid invoices are not acceptable).</li>
        <li>A list totalling the receipts.</li>
        <li>Photographs taken during progress and after completion of the project.&nbsp; See <a href="photograph.html"><strong>Photographs Guidelines</strong></a>.</li>
        <li>The completed <strong><a href="/living/pdf/declaration-project-completion.pdf">Declaration of Project Completion Form</a></strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Grant Payment</h2>
      <p>No grant payments can be made until the Saanich Heritage Foundation has received its annual funds from the Municipality.&nbsp; Once the funds are in place, and the work has been completed to the satisfaction of the SHF, then payment of the grant will be made. </p>
      <h2>How to Follow the Restoration Guideline</h2>
      <p> Refer to the <a href="restoration.html">Restoration Guidelines </a>&nbsp; page for more details
        concerning roofs, gutters, chimneys, masonry, foundations, storm or perimeter drains,
        woodwork and trim, windows, doors and paint, but these are some general rules: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Any necessary upgrading to foundation or basic structure should be done first. Obtain the advice of an architect or engineer if uncertain.</li>
        <li>Repair of old work and materials is preferable to replacement with new work.</li>
        <li>New work should replicate old work exactly. If old work is missing, its replacement should be based on historic and photographic research into the same or similar buildings. </li>
        <li>Ongoing maintenance, which minimizes the need for extensive repairs, is encouraged.</li>
      </ul>
