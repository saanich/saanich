      <p>While every effort is made by the Saanich Heritage Foundation (SHF) to provide correct
        information and guidance to Saanich home owners in making applications, neither SHF nor its
        members or staff individually warrant or guarantee the information given. </p>
      <p> The following list of exterior restoration principles can be used by as a guideline by designated heritage
        homeowners and their contractors. In planning the work, the owner should keep these general
        principles of restoration in mind: </p>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li>An overall rehabilitation plan is highly recommended if extensive work is anticipated. </li>
        <li>Repairs to the basic structure, foundation, and roof should be done first.</li>
        <li>All surface cleaning should be undertaken with the gentlest method available. </li>
        <li>Use contractors familiar with restoration work on heritage buildings if possible.</li>
        <li>Restoration and retention of original architectural features and materials. </li>
        <li>Repair of original materials is preferable to replacement with new work (where possible).</li>
        <li> New work should replicate old work exactly, or, if old work is already missing, new work
          should be based on research of archival (photographic) sources of the same or similar
          buildings. </li>
        <li> Ongoing maintenance will minimize the need for extensive repairs and is therefore
          preferred. </li>
        <li> All work shall be in accordance with &quot;<a href="http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/pages/standards-normes.aspx">The Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation
          of Historic Places in Canada</a>&quot;.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note: Saanich Heritage Foundation reserves the right to fund work in accordance with rehabilitation priorities. </p>
      <p> When obtaining quotes for a job, make sure you are dealing with all aspects of the work. For
        example: sometimes the fascia boards or roof sheathing around the eaves need replacing when
        the roof is done; and when windows are rebuilt or restored, make sure that you also get quotes
        for installation, and priming and painting. See the <a href="checklist.html">Estimate Checklist</a>. </p>
      <p> Please also note that it is the property owner's responsibility to make separate application
        for a Building Permit to the Inspection Services Division (475-1775) if required. </p>
      <h2>Roofs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> In most cases, preference will be given to original material - this almost invariably means
          cedar shingles (sawn on both faces), not shakes (split). </li>
      </ul>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li> Quality substitute roofing material will be considered <strong>(e.g. textured asphalt
          shingles to simulate cedar shingles)</strong>; for fire safety, it must be properly flashed
          in the valleys as per cedar shingle roofs.</li>
        <li>All layers of old roofing <strong>must</strong> be removed.</li>
        <li> Budget allowance must be made for rotten or damaged strapping or sheathing, especially at
          eaves and valleys. </li>
        <li> Ridge capping may have been metal or wood, and should be replaced as original, if known. </li>
        <li> Roof should precede gutters; but are new gutters and downspouts also necessary at this
          time? </li>
        <li> Ensure that nail length is correct for sheathing thickness to avoid protruding nails under
          eaves. </li>
        <li>Minimum warranty - ten (10) years for labour and manufacturers warranty.</li>
        <li> All workmanship shall be to standards endorsed by the Roofing Contractors
          Associations of BC (RCABC).  While the SHF does not require that the roofing contractors
          selected (to submit a bid) be members of the RCABC, we would highly encourage this to the
          homeowner for quality control. </li>
        <li><strong> Quotations must include "strip off" and "removal" from the job site, all roofing
          material. </strong></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Gutters and Downspouts</h2>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li> Original materials are preferred (ie. wood, galvanized iron), but prefinished aluminum is
          accepted. </li>
        <li>Vinyl or PVC are not acceptable.</li>
        <li>Original profile shape of the gutters should be repeated (eg. Roman Ogee).</li>
        <li>Downspouts should also match original - usually 2" round and connect to storm drains.</li>
        <li> Fascia boards and rafter tails should be checked for rot, and repairs included in estimate
          or budget. </li>
        <li>What is the condition of the storm drain system? - The SHF does consider funding for this work.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Chimneys and Masonry Work</h2>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li>We fund only exterior brickwork (ie.) chimney work from the roofline up, or on exterior wall (interior flue liners and venting upgrades to meet Building Code are not funded).</li>
        <li> Replacement bricks, if required, are to match the originals in profile, colour, texture
          and size. </li>
        <li>Do not use soot-stained bricks on the exterior.</li>
        <li>Profile and materials of the cap should match the original.</li>
        <li> Chimney pots should match original - if flue liners are being installed where they were
          not original, use minimum projection above chimney top as per Building Code requirements.</li>
        <li>Colour and profile of mortar joint should match original.</li>
        <li>Sand blasting or power washing should be avoided - paint can be removed chemically.</li>
        <li>Chimney liners are to be of types approved by municipal  authorities.</li>
        <li>Original (unlined) chimneys are no longer Code compliant and should be inspected by municipal authorities and upgraded accordingly. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Foundations, Storm and Perimeter Drains</h2>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li> We fund new foundations or seismic upgrades, but with only minimal change to the original floor level and exterior grades. </li>
        <li> We will not fund a foundation that is being either raised or dug deeper into the ground. </li>
        <li>Water-proofing,  a ground seal and proper ventilation is required.</li>
        <li> Check with Municipal Engineering Department for location and depth of storm drain and
          sanitary sewer connections. </li>
        <li> Skirting details - reconstruction should include the original or facsimile water table and
          base. </li>
        <li>A Professional Engineer may be required for new foundation design.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Exterior Woodwork and Trim </h2>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li>Must use No. 1 clear Douglas Fir lumber for replacement of exterior trim.</li>
        <li> Make exact profiles of original moulding profiles, siding profiles, balusters and
          ornamental trim when replacing and rebuilding. </li>
        <li>Research original design of porches and steps and missing ornament.</li>
        <li> Plywood is not historically correct. Fir flooring is still available. Most old porches are
          fir floored and steps have bull-nosed treads. </li>
        <li>All woodwork should be primed at time of installation.</li>
        <li>See <u>References</u>, p.4: <u>Well Preserved,</u> re: "Exterior Woodwork" pp. 136-139.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Windows and Doors</h2>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li> SHF does <strong>not</strong> fund double-glazed or thermal units in vinyl or aluminum
          frames. </li>
        <li>SHF does fund double-glazed or thermal units <strong><em>set in wood frames to match original windows</em>. </strong></li>
        <li> SHF does fund wooden storm windows: fixed, opening or removable. </li>
        <li>Replacement windows should, whenever possible, use "old" glass<em> <strong>(e.g. rolled) if
          suitable to the era of the home (and if available)</strong></em>. </li>
        <li> Replacement windows should replicate the historic windows in size, number of panes,
          maintain shape, frame, colour and reflective qualities of the glass. </li>
        <li> Muntin bars (the wood pieces dividing small panes of glass) are to be placed between
          separate pieces of glass, not just on top of one large piece of glass. </li>
        <li> New windows or storms must be primed before installation; be sure your price quote
          includes priming, painting, hardware and installation. </li>
        <li> Storm windows can increase the life of your historic windows by providing protection from
          the elements; storm windows also provide heat and sound insulation. </li>
        <li>Retain original operating mechanisms and hardware where possible.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Paint</h2>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li> The most important aspect of a paint job is the preparation. An improperly prepared
          surface will not hold paint. </li>
        <li> The type of paint must be carefully considered and of a quality that will last as long as
          possible - at least 7 years&nbsp; (Research this with a paint contractor/retailer).</li>
        <li> Woodwork and trim repairs and replacement that are required must be done prior to
          painting. </li>
        <li>No lead based paints.</li>
        <li>Obtain a written warranty for paint job.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Colour Schemes</h2>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li> Original colours are an option and may be determined by sanding in an inconspicuous spot. </li>
        <li> Alternative colour schemes should be sympathetic to the design and period of the house.
          (Research can be helpful here). </li>
        <li>Submit paint chips and detail accurately colour placement on the house.</li>
        <li>Use historical accuracy in placement of colours - don't pick out too much detail.</li>
        <li>For additional information, see <a href="colour.html">Colour Scheme Guidelines.</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li> Good preparation of surfaces is extremely important - get advice from experts. </li>
        <li> Power-washing or sand-blasting should be avoided. Handwashing is preferred to remove dirt.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Oil (alkyd) vs Latex (acrylic)</h2>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li> Depends on the condition of the surface, location on the house and design of the house. </li>
        <li> This information can be obtained from your paint contractor/retailer and is essential for
          best and lasting results. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Shingle Siding</h2>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li> Generally best oil-based stained unless already painted. </li>
        <li> Stain is easier and cheaper to apply, longer lasting, and allows the texture of the
          shingles to stand out better - it also doesn't peel like paint. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Some General Rules:</h2>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li> Acrylic (water base) paints generally last longer than oils and allow the wood to breathe
          and therefore are not likely to have wood rotting underneath the paint), so would be better
          than oil on most surfaces. </li>
        <li> Window sashes and doors, because they are meant to move, are best done in Alkyd gloss for
          highest abrasion resistance.</li>
        <li>No marine enamel. </li>
        <li> When old stains in the wood will leach through new layers of paint, the wood should be
          sealed with an oil primer. </li>
        <li> Half-timbering was likely meant to be a flat finish, to simulate an aged medieval,
          rough-hewn look. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>***A consultation with a SHF member could be beneficial.***</strong></p>
