      <p><img src="../../images/discover/zomba/zombakidz.gif" alt="" class="float-right"> The Zomba KIDZ Project began in 2006 as part of Saanich&rsquo;s Centennial celebrations. The
        project, undertaken by the 1,100 employees of Saanich, was launched in an effort to look
        outward and acknowledge our place in the world.</p>
      <p> <img src="../../images/discover/zomba/africa.jpg" alt="" class="float-left"> Saanich has had a relationship with Zomba, Malawi since 1988 when a municipal exchange was
        organized through the FCM. The Saanich Employees&rsquo; Centennial Project committee decided to
        direct its international development project to Zomba, and strengthen our relationship with
        this African community. </p>
      <p> In finding a project in the Zomba region, Saanich was able to partner with Chancellor College,
        a campus of the University of Malawi situated in Zomba. In 2006, the college&rsquo;s Home Economics
        Department had just begun an outreach project in Magalasi in early childhood development.
        Chancellor College, which has a relationship with the University of Victoria, wanted to use
        Magalasi as a learning laboratory for its students. </p>
      <p> <img src="../../images/discover/zomba/malawi.gif" alt="" class="float-right"> Through Chancellor College, Saanich had found a way to have a project delivered on the ground
        with local expertise. The project needed funds, and we needed a project. Zomba KIDZ was born! </p>
      <p> Magalasi is a small rural village within the region of Zomba in Malawi. Like many sub-Saharan
        countries, Magalasi is experiencing severe poverty, famine and has been devastated by
        HIV/AIDS. Many children are orphaned and are either heading families or have been absorbed in
        with extended family members or other tribal families. The pressure on surviving adults and on
        these children for basic survival - food, shelter, water - is tremendous. Education and basic
        health care are often out of the question. </p>
      <p> Through the <a href="project.html">Zomba KIDZ Project</a> we are focusing our attention on
        early childhood development and community initiatives. By investing in the children of Zomba,
        we hope to provide some small measure of hope for the future, in a community that so
        desperately needs our help.</p>
