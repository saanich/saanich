<p>In June 1988 the Federal government launched the Africa 2000 project. Under the auspices of
        the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, municipalities were invited to form partnerships
        with comparably sized African municipalities. Saanich was among the first seven Canadian
        municipalities to join the program in September 1988 and was partnered with the City of Zomba
        in Malawi.</p>
<h2>The FCM Partnership Program</h2>
The Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM)  International Partnership Program provides
					    	 funding to permit Canadian municipalities to share their expertise with a partner
					    	 municipality in a developing country .The current focus of the program is on staff exchanges
					    	 and training. Canadian municipal staff with a particular expertise visit the partner
					    	 municipality for two or three weeks to carry out training and on other occasions staff from
					    	 the international partner will visit Canada for training and orientation.
<p> A large part of the funding for the program is provided by the Canadian International
  Development Agency (CIDA).  The core values of the program are: "Our priority is the
  empowerment of municipal government as the preferred means to achieve effective governance and
  sustainable development. Our actions are based on the sharing of skills, technologies and
  knowledge in a cooperative manner. We recognize and respect racial and cultural differences,
  and we value the learning opportunities offered by the experiences of municipal governments
  within various historical, political and cultural context. We believe in the participation in
  Canadian municipal governments in international activities. We value and promote mutual
  economic development opportunities. Ultimately, we believe in the need to build bridges
  between municipal governments around the world as a means to improve living conditions."</p>
