      <img src="../../images/discover/zomba/zombaKidzCentre.jpg" alt="" class="float-left"><p>  In March 2008 it was announced that Lois Silo, the Zomba Kidz Project Coordinator from
        Chancellor College had departed and that responsibility for the project would be transferred
        to Khama Chibwana. Khama a home economics professor at Chancellor College and former grad
        student at UVic originated the concept for the Zomba Kidz Project and is welcomed as the new
        Project Coordinator. </p>
      <p> In a report dated March 5, 2008 Khama said "The maize crop is beginning to dry up. From my
        observation we may have slightly lower yields this year than last year. The maize cobs did not
        grow as much as last year because there was lots of rainfall at the beginning of the rainy
        season and that was followed by a prolonged period (3 - 4 weeks) of no rain at all.
        Notwithstanding, we expect to get reasonable benefit from this investment." </p>
      <p> Khama has recently reported that the Muula Centre is once again feeding approximately two
        hundred children from the surrounding village. </p>
      <p> On September 23rd, 2007, the Muula Day Care Centre built with funds raised by Saanich&rsquo;s
        Centennial Zomba Kidz project was officially opened. </p>
      <p> A crowd of over 500 people watched the ribbon cutting for the new centre including 3 cabinet
        ministers from the Malawi government along with 6 Chiefs from the local village of Magalasi
        and the surrounding area. </p>
      <p> Saanich was represented at the opening by Judith Evans, Adjunct Assistant Professor at the
        University of Victoria School of Child and Youth Care. </p>
      <p>Saanich employee Don Pedde, acting chair of the project, said:</p>
      <p> "All the Saanich employees, citizens and businesses that supported the project should take
        great pride in what has been achieved. Their donations have produced an outstanding child care
        facility in an area where the need could not be more desperate. The building was built to
        handle 150 kids and we are now told that 273 kids are enrolled in the programs." </p>
      <p> Since 2006, over $52,000 has been raised through employee donations, bake sales, craft sales,
        donations from Saanich businesses and outside donors. All of the money raised has been sent to
        Malawi to pay for a feeding program for the children, teacher salaries, a maize growing
        program and the construction of the new facility. The new child care centre, named the Muula
        Centre, includes a 2000 sq.ft. school building, a separate 335 sq.ft. kitchen and a separate
        485 sq.ft. washroom plus a new well to provide drinking water to the centre and the village. </p>
