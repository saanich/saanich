      <p> The main project goal was to build a central community facility where children in the region
        could come in safety to play, learn, receive nutrition, and get basic healthcare. A school
        feeding program provides each child with 100% of their nutritional needs every day. </p>
      <p> Between 150 and 200 children have been attending the community childcare program. Up until
        now, it has operated in the open air, and in poorly-constructed huts. Weather is a significant
        problem, particularly in the rainy season, between December and March. </p>
      <p> In addition, there are initiatives to support the entire community such as drilling a well and
        buying agricultural supplies to grow crops. The community identified a plot for community
        farming. We provided funds for tools, seed and fertilizer so that planting could occur in
        December at the start of the rainy season. The seeds germinate in the wet conditions and crops
        are harvested in April. The harvest augments the school feeding program.</p>

      <p class="float-clear">In 2006, Saanich employees and the Saanich community raised over $40,000 to accomplish the
        following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Construct a community childcare centre</li>
        <li>Drill a borehole (well) to provide fresh water to the community</li>
        <li>Provide a quality early childhood program for pre-school age children</li>
        <li>Operate a school feeding program</li>
        <li>Begin a community agricultural program</li>
        <li>Train workers and volunteers in early childhood programming</li>
        <li>Pay a living wage to childcare workers</li>
        <li> Provide an opportunity for Chancellor College students to have hands-on experience in
          early childhood care and practices. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> It is anticipated that the construction of the Centre will be complete by March 2007. The
        centre will have a school, kitchen block and latrines. </p>
      <p> In January 2007, Saanich employees launched their second annual Zomba KIDZ campaign and raised
        an additional $11,000. The funds will pay for supplies and equipment for the community centre
        and continue to support the school feeding program, community care workers, and agricultural
        activities. In the years upcoming, it is hoped that more economic development activities for
        the community can eventually be undertaken that will lift it out of the crushing poverty that
        exists today. </p>
