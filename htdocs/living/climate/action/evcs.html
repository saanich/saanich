      <p>Saanich residents will find some new landmarks at neighbourhood recreation facilities and the Municipal Hall. Twelve new Level 2 electric vehicle (EV) charging stations have been installed to support the expanding number of EVs in the community. These stations add to the more than 80 Level 2 stations that are being installed in the Capital Region. These stations will be free to EV customers for the first year of operation. 2 EV stations can be found at the each of the following locations:<a href="../../../images/living/climate/action/Charging-Station-Map-Large.png" class="lightbox"><img src="../../../images/living/climate/action/Charging-Station-Map.png" alt="Charging Station Map" width="150" height="176" hspace="10" align="right"></a></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Saanich Municipal Hall, 770 Vernon Ave </li>
        <li>Saanich Commonwealth Place, 4636 Elk Lake Drive </li>
        <li>Cedar Hill Recreation Centre, 3220 Cedar Hill Rd </li>
        <li>Cedar Hill Golf Course, 1400 Derby Road </li>
        <li>Pearkes Recreation Centre, 3100 Tillicum Rd </li>
        <li>Gordon Head Recreation Centre, 4100 Lambrick Way</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><strong>Using the Stations is Easy</strong></h2>
      <p>The stations use a simple card swipe system that will provide access with a simple pass of a credit card or pass card provided by the station supplier AddEnergie.

      <p>For the first year of operation, Saanich will be providing free EV charging to residents with a 3 hour maximum time limit. Stations will be posted on the <a href="http://www.plugshare.com/">www.plugshare.com</a>&nbsp; website.</p>
      <p>The Municipality sees the arrival of electric vehicles as the beginning of a shift in vehicle use and a key component of the Saanich Climate Action Plan. The Municipality set a 2020 target of 5,000 electric vehicles in the community when the Plan was passed by Council in April 2010 and a 33% reduction target in community greenhouse gas emissions. EVs have a role to play in reducing emissions as Saanich cars, trucks and SUV&rsquo;s emit over 200,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas each year which represents 50% of total community emissions.</p>
      <p>The infrastructure incentives that are supporting these charging stationsis part of the Province's $2.74 million Community Charging Infrastructure Fund (CCIF) that will lead to 570 public charging stations across BC by March 31, 2013. This fund is being managed by the non-profit Fraser Basin Council. The incentives cover up to 75% of the capital and installation costs up to a maximum of $4,000 per Level 2 charger. </p>
