      <h2>Electric Vehicle Pilot </h2>
      <p>Saanich is very excited to announce the addition of the Mitsubishi i-MiEV to its vehicle fleet. Though a pilot program with Mitsubishi Motors, the municipality will be replacing an old unleaded gas vehicle with the car that is going to change the way we think about driving and fuel use. This car goes 120 km on a single charge, has a top speed and safety ratings of regular cars and feels great to drive.&nbsp; <a href="pdf/Saanich_Electric_Vehicle_Media_Release_Feb25_2011.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Media Release.</strong></a></p>

      <h2>Fleet Centre Upgrades </h2>
      <p>Almost half of emissions from Saanich municipal operations comes from building energy use. Several buildings have been identified as key upgrade opportunities due to their function and age of infrastructure. The fleet centre has large bay doors that allows heat to escape easily. Changes to this building include upgrades to the bay door system and a technology change to the type of heating system which will greatly reduce its carbon footprint. </p>

      <h2>Solar Hot Water Showers at Gordon Head </h2>
      <p>Saanich is very excited to have our first solar hot water system installed on a municipal building at our Gordon Head Recreation Center. Next time you are at Gordon Head, take a look at the four panels on the roof that are now heating the centers shower water. The system is expected to reduce our carbon footprint by 20 tonnes annually (almost 400 GJ of Natural Gas). </p>

      <h2>Electric Zamboni </h2>
      <p>There&rsquo;s a new ice resurfacing unit cleaning the ice sheets at Pearkes Recreation Centre, but with zero-emissions! Replacing the old propane unit eliminates 6,000L of propane and reduces our carbon footprint by 10 tonnes of greenhouse gas annually. Plus, it is one smooth, quiet ride. Keep an eye out for it next time you are at Pearkes! </p>

      <h2>Climate Change Timeline</h2>
      <p>The <a href="/living/climate/pdf/climate_change_electronic.pdf">Climate Change Evolution</a> brochure is a twenty year snapshot of the key actions Saanich has taken both independently and in cooperation with other municipalities and levels of government to address climate change and promote energy efficiency.</p>
