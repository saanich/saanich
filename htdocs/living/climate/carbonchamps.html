      <h2>Meet Our Carbon Champions!</h2>
      <h3>Sarah Webb, Saanich Resident <a name="webb"></a></h3>
      <p><img src="../../images/living/climate/webb_small.jpg" alt="" class="float-left">&quot;One of the biggest commitments I have made to keep my carbon footprint small is to cycle or take transit to work every day. This became a little more challenging four years ago when we had our son, but with the help of a new bicycle extension and BC Transit's program to have children under 5 ride free, we have been able to maintain a low-carbon commute. Each morning, Quinn and I enjoy the fresh air, plus we save thousands of dollars each year.&quot; </p>
      <h3 class="float-clear">Gabe Epstein, Julia Menard, Kate Rubin - Coordinators, Gorge Tillicum Urban Farmers <a name="urbanfarmers"></a></h3>
      <p><img src="../../images/living/climate/farmers_small.jpg" class="float-left" alt="">&quot;In the summer of 2008 several Saanich residents wanted to explore the idea of growing food and increasing food security in the Gorge Tillicum Area. As a result of the hard work of some dedicated community members the Gorge Tillicum Urban Farmers (GTUF) came to fruition. GTUF now connects, supports and educates community members in their pursuit to produce local, environmentally sustainable food. By providing support for local food production we are mitigating the impacts of climate change by reducing the amount of energy required to provide food to our community.&quot;</p>
      <h3 class="float-clear">Clean Air Landscaping<a name="clean"></a></h3>
      <p><img src="../../images/living/climate/clean_small.jpg" alt="" class="float-left">Clean Air Landscaping was created to become Canada's first truly "green" landscaper, utilizing renewable solar energy to power all of the company&rsquo;s yard care equipment. &nbsp;Cordless and electric mowers, trimmers and blowers are all powered from the mobile solar trailer pulled by a hybrid truck. &nbsp;&nbsp;Yard care services by Clean Air therefore produce no harmful emissions, no greenhouse gases and very little noise.&nbsp; Since Clean Air Landscaping started in 2010 it has developed residential, commercial and strata contracts in the community.&nbsp; Clean Air Landscaping is a leader in the use of green energy for residential and commercial services in Saanich.&nbsp;</p>
      <h3 class="float-clear">Michael McGee and Earth's CO2 Home Page<a name="mcgee"></a></h3>
      <p><img src="http://actionwidgets.org/custo/aaa179-co2-saanich.png" alt="" class="float-left">Since December 2007, Saanich resident Michael McGee has been updating "Earth's CO2 Home Page" so anyone can find the latest data for CO2 levels in the atmosphere -- the heart of the global warming problem. Michael is a husband, father and provincial government employee.&nbsp; On the side, he keeps improving the website and learning about the causes of rising CO2 levels, the impacts and the many solutions.&nbsp; By combining BC Hydro and Bullfrog Power, electricity for his Saanich home is 100% clean.&nbsp; Within the next couple of years, he hopes to replace the oil tank with an electric heat pump, and the gas-powered van with a plug-in hybrid or all-electric.&nbsp; CO2Now.org also runs on servers powered directly by solar panels.

      <h3 class="float-clear">Jawl Properties making sustainability the new business-as-usual<a name="jawl"></a></h3>
      <p><img src="../../images/living/climate/jawl_small.jpg" alt="" class="float-left">Karen Jawl and dedicated&nbsp;green team member Lorena Lennox&nbsp;from Jawl Properties has led property management and green initiatives to a new standard for green building management. After reviewing 14 of its buildings for energy use, waste management, water use and other environmental factors, changes&nbsp;were implemented to reduce GHG emissions and the resulting operating costs. GHG emissions in these buildings were reduced 206 tonnes in 2009 and another 212 tonnes in 2010. <a href="http://www.jawlproperties.com/green-program-summary" target="_blank">Learn more about&nbsp;green initiatives at Jawl Properties</a>.</p>
