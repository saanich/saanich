      <p>The District of Saanich would like to advise the public of a substance release into the Colquitz River.&nbsp; A sheen was discovered yesterday around noon by Saanich Public Works staff during a routine inspection. The material was found to be seeping from a roadside bank at Interurban and Columbine Way.&nbsp; Within an hour provincial authorities were contacted, booms were placed in the river to contain and collect the substance, and samples were taken to a local lab to identify both the source and nature of the substance.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>It is unknown how long the material will continue to seep out of the bank. Crews have put up signs advising pedestrians to keep pets and children away from the river&rsquo;s edge in the immediate downstream area. BC Hydro is on site investigating to determine if the material is escaping from high voltage cables beneath Interurban Road.</p>
      <p>Almost one year ago, a major oil spill occurred on Swan Creek.&nbsp; It was fortunate that many of the returning Coho Salmon were past the spill site when it occurred, however fish mortalities did occur at the fish-counting fence downstream on the Colquitz River. While this current seepage appears to be a gradual release, the District of Saanich notified the volunteers running the fish-counting fence as soon as the spill was known so that they could monitor the situation.</p>
      <p>Residents and community environmental stewards are asked to continue to report spills immediately for the health of our streams.</p>
