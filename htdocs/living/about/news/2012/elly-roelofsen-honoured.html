      <p style="text-align:justify;">Mayor Frank Leonard and Council will bestow the honour of the Queen&rsquo;s Diamond Jubilee Medal to Elly Roelofsen at the Council meeting to be held at Saanich Municipal Hall, 770 Vernon Avenue on Monday, October 22, 2012 at 7:30pm. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">The Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee commemorative medal was created to mark the 2012 celebrations of the 60th anniversary of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II's accession to the Throne. The medal is a tangible way for Canada to honour Her Majesty for her service to this country. At the same time, it serves to honour significant contributions and achievements by Canadians. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">Saanich Council is recognizing Ms. Roelofsen with the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee medal for her outstanding contributions to promote waste reduction in the region. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">Ms. Roelofsen was an early promoter of a recycling bluebox program in Saanich as a member of the Recycling Committee that investigated the idea in 1979. Over the years since she has volunteered on a number of committees at Saanich and with the Capital Regional District on environmental issues including curbside collection, household hazardous waste collection and composting. She was an active participant in the CRD Speakers Bureau since its inception and through the bureau participated in dozens of environmental education outreach events and speaking engagements. Her lifelong commitment to waste reduction and contributions to Saanich and the Capital Region make her well deserving of this special honour. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;"></p>
      Ms. Roelofsen has previously been recognized with the Saanich Environmental Award (Long Term Environmental Achievement, 2000) and Capital Regional District Eco-Star Award. <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
