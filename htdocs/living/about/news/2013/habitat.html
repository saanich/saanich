      <p><strong><img src="images/clip_image002.jpg" alt="Habitat for Humanity Victoria. " width="321" height="161" class="float-right">Saanich, BC</strong><strong> </strong>&#8212; The District of Saanich and Habitat for Humanity Victoria have signed an agreement that will see Habitat pursue its next build project in the Municipality&rsquo;s North Quadra community.</p>
      <p>With a history of welcoming affordable housing, Saanich was seeking a new opportunity at the same time that Habitat was searching for a suitable location to continue its Affordable Homeownership Program.&nbsp; Working together, a piece of surplus Municipal property at 4000 Cedar Hill Cross Road was identified as a good location for families and a conditional purchase agreement has been signed.&nbsp; Habitat has already introduced the project to the neighbourhood as it seeks to rezone the site and construct a modest multi-unit townhouse.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;We are proud to partner with Habitat for Humanity and support their work in bringing affordable family homes into our community,&rdquo; said Mayor Frank Leonard.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Cedar Hill Cross Road location is ideal for families.&nbsp; We anticipate a creative building design that respects the neighbourhood and we look forward to public input as the rezoning application proceeds.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Habitat Victoria&rsquo;s last two builds, a duplex and a five-plex, were both in Saanich and we have an excellent working relationship with the Council and staff,&rdquo; said David McLean, Board Chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;As we move forward, the really important relationships become the ones established by our partner families with their new neighbours, so we are pleased to be able to work with the community in North Quadra.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>As part of its Affordable Homeownership Program Habitat Victoria has constructed 8 of its homes in Saanich, most recently the Ker Avenue duplex project and the award-winning Flex-Plex on the corners of Saanich and Bethune.&nbsp; Mayor Leonard has stated that Saanich will continue to seek opportunities with Habitat to achieve mutual goals.</p>
