        <p>Cart selection cards are being mailed to every Saanich garbage collection customer during the week of June 17.</p>

      <p>Saanich residential garbage customers can now choose their garbage and organics recycling cart sizes that will be part of the Greener Garbage Collection program.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Residents are asked to watch their mailbox for their &ldquo;Greener Garbage Cart Selection Card&rdquo;. If they would like carts other than the standard 120-litre organics recycling and standard 180-litre garbage carts, the &ldquo;Greener Garbage Cart Selection Card&rdquo; should be returned to Saanich Solid Waste Services by July 5.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Starting Spring 2014, organics recycling and garbage will be collected from Saanich single and multi-family households every two weeks. A great new feature of Greener Garbage Collection is that yard trimmings can be added to the organics recycling cart too.</p>
      <p>Most households will see their service fees remain about the same, depending on the cart sizes they choose. In 2013, Saanich garbage collection customers will pay $156 for solid waste services. In 2014, this will be replaced with customers paying an annual base fee of $105 for solid waste services plus an annual cart fee for their garbage and organics recycling carts ($25, $35 or $70). </p>
      <p>The carts are not being rented. The cart fees being charged cover the ongoing costs for disposal and processing of garbage and organics recycling collected in the carts at the Hartland landfill and compost facility.</p>
      <p>To collect both garbage and organics recycling efficiently and control costs, Saanich will change to automated curbside collection where carts are emptied from the curb using a mechanical arm on a truck. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Assistance programs will be provided to residents who have mobility challenges and are not able to place their carts curbside on collection day. Residents are asked to apply for assistance by completing the &ldquo;Assistance Program&rdquo; section on their selection card.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Providing organics recycling is a big step towards making Saanich cleaner, greener and more sustainable and will substantially reduce the amount of garbage taken to the landfill. With the ban on kitchen scraps at the landfill coming into effect January 1, 2015, Saanich is providing more opportunities for customers to recycle, choose cart sizes that work best for their household and  divert 8,000 tonnes of organics from the landfill every year. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Greener Garbage Collection carts and kitchen containers will be delivered to homes in Spring 2014. </p>
