      <p>Saanich has a large number of committees and boards, most of which are advisory to Council. There
        are three primary types of committees (standing, select and advisory) that are established by the
        Mayor or the Mayor and Council.&nbsp; There are also statutory boards and authorities established
        by senior levels of government. The complete list is available in this section.</p>

      <h2>Municipal Appointments to Advisory Committees</h2>
      <p> Each year in the late fall the Mayor and Council appoint citizens to serve as representatives
        on various committees and organizations. Anyone interested in being considered for an
        appointment should submit an <a href="pdf/application%20form%20for%20advisory%20committees%202014%20(for%20web).pdf">application
          form</a><img src="/images/logos/pdf.gif" alt="pdf document"> to the Legislative Division.

      <p> <strong>Advisory Committees</strong> form the majority of Saanich's committees as is the
        common practice in many municipalities. These committees, including mandate and membership,
        are established by Council and most include one Council member as Chair. </p>
      <p> <strong>Standing Committees</strong> are those established by the Mayor for matters considered
        to be better regulated and managed by means of such committees. The Mayor appoints all members
        of a standing committee. At least one-half the members must be Council members. The Finance, Audit
        and Personnel Committee is the only existing standing committee. </p>
      <p> <strong>Statutory Boards and Authorities</strong> are created and regulated through provincial
        and federal legislation. Each Board and Authority has a unique function within the Municipal
        framework. </p>
      <p> <strong>Technical Committees</strong> are administrative committees that deal with specific
        technical matters. Technical committees may include a Council member as Chair or as a liaison. </p>
      <p> <strong>Select Committees</strong> are appointed to consider or inquire into any matter and to
        report their findings and opinions to the Council. Select committees may be made up of only
        Councillors or a combination of Councillors, members of the public, and/or staff. Select
        committees are meant to be finite in nature and tend to be the Task Forces that are appointed
        from time to time. </p>
