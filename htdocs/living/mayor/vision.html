<p> Saanich is a model steward working diligently to improve and balance the natural and built
        environments. Saanich restores and protects air, land and water quality, the biodiversity of
        existing natural areas and ecosystems, the network of natural areas and open spaces and urban
        forests. The challenges posed by climate change are responded to. "Centres" and "Villages"
      accommodate the majority of future growth, using green building practices.</p>
      <p> <img src="../../images/living/mayor/cuthbert_vision.jpg" alt="Cuthbert Holmes Park Bridge-Photo by Angela Wyatt" width="228" height="216" class="float-right">Vibrant, distinct neighbourhoods provide a high quality of life for individuals and families.
        A variety of travel modes connect neighbourhoods and businesses, allowing for the effective,
        efficient and safe movement of people, goods and services. Walking, cycling and transit are
        viable and popular travel options, resulting in less car dependence. Rural and farm land is
        protected by adherence to the Urban Containment Boundary. </p>
      <p> Saanich offers opportunities for balanced, active and diverse lifestyles. Housing, public
        services and amenities are affordable, accessible and inclusive. Residents enjoy food security
        through the safeguarding of agricultural land and the promotion of community gardens and urban
        farming. The community's heritage is valued and promoted. Residents take advantage of a
        diverse range of recreational, educational, civic, social, arts and cultural services. </p>
      <p> Community activities and events generate inter-generational and inter-cultural interest,
        participation and social integration. Land-use planning, infrastructure design and service
        delivery continue to address public safety issues. Citizen awareness, education and
        collaborative involvement promote a shared responsibility and ownership of community
        development. </p>
      <p> Saanich's economy is connected locally, regionally and globally, providing diverse economic
        opportunities, ranging from high technology to agriculture. Our economy and labour force is
        responsive and has the ability to adapt to change. Saanich's clean, appealing environment,
        skilled workforce, responsive public services and excellent community infrastructure make it
        an ideal location to live, work and conduct business. </p>
      <p> Implementation of strategic economic development strategies sustains and enhances the economy
        and ensures long-term financial sustainability, while meeting social and environmental
        commitments. Saanich ensures sustainability through the provision of efficient, affordable,
        accessible and reliable public services, programs and utilities that meet community
        expectations and are achieved through careful management, fiscal responsibility, innovation,
        progress monitoring, community involvement and meaningful consultation.</p>
