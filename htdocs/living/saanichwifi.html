      <h2>What are Saanich WiFi Terms and Conditions?</h2>
      <p> <u>Saanich is not liable</u>: Saanich is not responsible or
        liable for any losses or damages, direct or indirect, arising from any access
        to or use of the wireless network. Saanich provides wireless network access and
        use as a privilege, not a right. Accordingly, such access or use may be
        terminated, restricted or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of Saanich
        or its representatives for any reason whatsoever. Any person who accesses or
        uses the wireless service is personally responsible and liable for his or her
        own actions and use. Access and use of the Internet and email shall be at your
        own risk.</p>
      <p> <u>Internet content may be unreliable or offensive</u>: The
        Internet offers access to a wealth of material that can be personally and
        professionally enriching. Be warned, however, that it is an unregulated
        environment containing information and opinions that range in scope from
        reliable and authoritative to harmful, controversial, extremely offensive or
        inflammatory. Some information found on the Internet may not be accurate,
        complete, or current and may be subject to change without notice. Reliance upon
        any material on the Internet shall be at your sole risk: all such material
        should be verified independently before you use or rely on it. Saanich is not
        responsible or liable for the content or quality of material retrieved and
        makes no warranty, express or implied, as to any material found on the
        Internet. In addition, Saanich shall not be held responsible or liable for
        server, hardware, or software settings, Internet transmission, monitor settings
        or website design and construction that produce incomplete or inaccurate data,
        material and information that maybe received and/or displayed on your Internet
        browser.</p>
      <p> <u>Prohibited activities</u>: You shall not use the wireless
        network to send spam, bulk, and threatening emails or to hack websites,
        networks, servers, computers or other devices. You shall not contaminate any
        other computer, device, hardware or software with viruses, worms, spy-ware,
        phishing, or in any other way.</p>
      <p><u> Third Party Sites</u>: References, links, hyperlinks and
        advertising contained on any Saanich or third party website are not approval,
        endorsements, or support of either Saanich for the third party or for the third
        party's goods and/or services. Saanich is not responsible or liable nor is any
        responsibility or liability assumed for incompatibility, loss of privacy, invasion
        of privacy, privacy disputes, non-suitability, viruses, loss of service, or any
        other problem of any kind arising from or in connection with the third party,
        the third party's website or the third party's goods and/or services.</p>
      <p> <u>Parents responsible for supervising children</u>: Saanich
        recognizes the concerns about the potential harm caused to minor children when
        they are exposed to criminal, obscene or hate material on the Internet. Saanich
        uses reasonable efforts to prevent access to these types of material by
        providing a filtered wireless network. However, filtering is not a perfect
        system. Therefore, the supervision of minor children using the Internet while
        using the Saanich wireless connection points is the responsibility of their
        parents or guardians.</p>
      <p> As with all Internet services, parents and guardians are
        expected to be, and shall be responsible for providing guidance and control of
        a minor child's access to and use of the wireless network, email and the
        Internet while using Saanich wireless connection points. Any restriction or
        prohibition of a minor's access and use of the wireless network, email or
        Internet shall be the responsibility and liability of the minor child's parent
        or guardian.</p>
