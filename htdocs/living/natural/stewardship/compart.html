    <h2>Beckwith Park
    </h2><p><img src="../../../images/IMG00075-20110122-1510_000.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="161" class="float-right"></p>
    <p>Beckwith Park is in the North Quadra neighbourhood of Saanich. The west half of the park contains sports fields, a water park and playground; the east half contains a natural area with trails, a wetland system and a .7 hectare Garry Oak woodland.</p>
    <p>The Friends of Beckwith Park, a volunteer organization operating since early 2010, have been focused on carrying out restoration work in the natural area of Beckwith Park.&nbsp; As a group of neighbouring citizens who all enjoy the park, we wanted to ensure that the invasive species that were taking hold were brought under control before it was too late.    </p>
    <p>Our restoration area has been divided into nine unique work zones.&nbsp; In the brief time that we have been holding regular work parties, the removal of Scotch Broom, Himalayan Blackberry, Daphne Laurel and English Ivy in three or four zones has been our priority. We tried tackling Orchard grass once &ndash; but can&rsquo;t say it was a hit with the group, though we have seen some benefit from that particular work session! </p>
    <p>In spring 2011, we had the assistance of neighbouring Lake Hill School elementary students planting 31 Garry Oaks in our woodland.&nbsp; In the future, we will expand to tackle more zones and we will begin working closer to the wetlands.&nbsp; The plan is to restore the shoreline to provide protection for the birds, amphibians and turtles, and to control soil erosion. </p>
    <p>It has been exciting for all of us to see the lack of yellow during the Scotch Broom bloom this year and new Licorice Ferns and native flowers growing where large swaths of blackberry once grew.&nbsp; We feel fortunate that the park is small enough with restoration worthy areas that we really can make a difference.&nbsp; It will require continuous effort over a long term, we know, but seeing results so early is very encouraging.</p>
    <h2>Brodick and Bow Parks/Feltham Trail</h2>
    <p><img src="../../../images/2BowM1109.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="161" class="float-right"></p>
    <p>In January 2007 a small group of neighbours organized to restore Brodick and Bow Parks (and Feltham Trail that bisects these parks). Our goal is to minimize and manage the spread of non-native, invasive plant species and restore the health of the existing Garry Oak ecosystem in this area. In addition to the physical removal of invasive plants we also replant with native plant species where needed. Since 2007 our project has evolved to include the addition of wildlife habitat. In 2009/10 nest boxes were installed in Bow Pond and have successfully produced broods of Wood Duck ducklings. &nbsp;In 2011, we added smaller nest boxes for Violet Green Swallows and Chickadees.</p>
    <p>Brodick and Bow Parks are well used, much loved neighbourhood parks. Native flora and wildlife are slowly rebounding and good progress has been made, (especially around Bow Pond), to remove invasive species through the ongoing efforts of volunteers and Saanich Parks staff. We are a small group and we truly need additional help to sustain this project so please consider volunteering a bit of your time this year to keep our project alive.</p>
    <h2>Colquitz River Park</h2>
    <p><img src="../../../images/F985.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="161" class="float-right"></p>
    <p>The active restoration area of this long lineal park is located between Rolston Crescent cul-de-sac and the McKenzie Avenue overpass, plus along the park trail for a short way back towards Tillicum Shopping&nbsp; Centre.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>In October 2009, at a cul-de-sac dinner, several&nbsp; neighbours decided to form a group, later named the Rolston Reclaimers, and start the mammoth task of reclaiming the park area described above.&nbsp; Once a month we have gathered for several hours and removed loads of blackberries, ivy, thistles, puny red hawthorne, privot and other invasives.&nbsp; We reclaimed a large meadow that had existed in earlier years, uncovered a lovely, big Indian Plum shrub and stands of Nootka Rose and Black Hawthorne, trimmed several large species willows and uncovered an active red and black ant nest which has become a neighbourhood masco. It is located where it is no trouble and besides they eat carpenter ants!&nbsp; It has been interesting to observe ant activity throughout the year.&nbsp; Of course, this clearing has resulted in tremendous secondary growth of invasives, mostly thistle.&nbsp; We battle on.</p>
    <p>In winter 2010, two men in our group started development&nbsp; of a Garry Oak Meadow located well before the overpass. &nbsp;These noble souls laid a circle of cardboard and covered&nbsp; it with a thick layer of oakleaf mulch.&nbsp; The weather was awful!&nbsp; The following June the wee Garry Oaks were planted.&nbsp; Eventually, the bulbs and plants will be added as shown in the CRD Wildflowers and Other Native Plants of Garry Oak Ecosystems brochure.&nbsp; More native plants and shrubbery will added over time.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>We gather for a two-hour work-party once a month.&nbsp; If your schedule allows for less commitment, you are still welcome.</p>
    <h2>Cuthbert Holmes Park</h2>
    <p><img src="../../../images/TreePlantingatCuthbertHolmes.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="186" class="float-right"></p>
    <p>Cuthbert Holmes Park seems to be one of Saanich&rsquo;s best-kept secrets.&nbsp; Despite its large size (26 hectares) and high-visibility location (beside Tillicum Centre and the Trans-Canada Highway), I am frequently asked where it is when I mention its name.</p>
    <p>Cuthbert Holmes Park is a mixture of forest and recovering agricultural land in the Coastal Douglas-fir ecosystem with areas of Garry Oak ecosystem; two of the most endangered ecosystems in Canada.&nbsp; A 1.6 km stretch of the salmon-bearing Colquitz River meanders through the park, which also boasts a Great Blue Heron rookery, which at last count was the largest on Vancouver Island.&nbsp; Great Horned Owls and Cooper&rsquo;s Hawks can also be seen regularly in the park.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The park was the subject of a recent independent environmental review which confirmed what locals already knew; that we have an ecological gem in our midst. The park is not without its challenges, however.&nbsp; Invasive exotic species have taken a firm hold on the park.&nbsp; English Ivy, Daphne Laurel, English Hawthorn, English Holly, Himalayan Blackberry and Privet are the most prevalent.</p>
    <p>Two years ago, volunteers became active in removing invasive species from certain areas in the park.&nbsp; With the assistance of a grant obtained by the Gorge Tillicum Community Association and a donation of native plants from the Pacific Forestry Centre, we worked with Saanich Parks and the community to plant approximately 1,500 trees and shrubs in these areas in fall 2010.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to maintain and expand these restoration areas, and in doing so, build community relationships and provide people with an opportunity to re-connect with nature. We advocate for protecting the park&rsquo;s natural features and ecosystems, as we feel fortunate to have such an important ecological area in an urban setting.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Saanich Parks is currently undertaking a community consultation to guide the future of the park. For further information or to provide feedback (before September 15, 2011), visit our <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/parkrec/parks/projects/current/cuthbert.html">Current Projects page</a>.</p>
    <h2>Mount Douglas Park</h2>
    <p>Mt Douglas Park is a well used, much loved park. In fact, one could say it is being loved to death. Native flora and wildlife are still plentiful in many areas, but ongoing care and attention by all is a must to protect its native plant life, to continue the ongoing restoration process, and to prevent new and nasty invasive plant species taking hold in the park. </p>
    <p>Volunteers have been active in Mount Douglas Park with the Friends of Mount Douglas Park Society since 1991. For some years, members of this Society have been working to remove invasive plant species from the park. Mt Douglas is a very large park, (approximately 500 acres), and volunteer numbers are on the low side. However, thanks to the efforts of a couple of fellows who put in phenomenal hours in the park each year, this group has managed to clear approximately 125 acres of invasive plants, (as of November 2011).&nbsp; Given the size of the park the task ahead will take many years to complete, unless volunteer numbers increase. Further, the majority of current volunteers are retired people and it will take an influx of youth to really make the difference and to see that this work carries on into the future. Removing invasive species is an ongoing effort with secondary and sometimes tertiary clearing needed at previously cleared areas to remove remnants of re-growth and ensure invasive plants do not re-establish. </p>
    <p>Our goal is to minimize and manage the spread of non-native, invasive plant species and restore the ecological health of this park. In addition to the physical removal of invasive plants we also replant with native plant species as needed and actively participate each Tree Appreciation Day to plant out designated areas, as per Saanich Parks restoration plans. We are a small group and we truly need additional help to sustain this project so please consider volunteering a bit of your time this year to keep our project alive.</p>
    <p>Work parties are currently held Thursday mornings, 10:00 a.m. to Noon. Periodically, Sunday work parties are also held. With sufficient demand from volunteers our current schedule could certainly be enhanced to accommodate personal schedule demands. As with all Pulling Together projects, no previous, related experience is needed with on-site training provided. Gloves and tools are also supplied for use at work parties.</p>
