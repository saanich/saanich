      <p>The District of Saanich is expanding its Environmentally Significant Areas (ESA) mapping.&nbsp; The purpose of this initiative is to improve our existing inventories by looking for areas that may have been missed during past mapping initiatives.&nbsp; These inventories appear in our <a href="#atlases">three atlases</a> which flag ESA&rsquo;s, some of which are protected in development permit areas.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Data collection for this initiative will occur in two phases.&nbsp; In <strong>phase 1</strong>, the public are invited to send information on sites that could be of interest which may be visited by our consultant for further scientific data collection.&nbsp; In <strong>phase 2</strong>, the consultant will collect data on sites that they have researched through various sources of published information.</p>
      <h2>What are we looking for?</h2>
      <p><img alt="blue grey slug K Ovanksa Dec 2010" class="float-right" src="../../../images/living/env/esa/blue-grey-slug_K-Ovanksa_dec-2010-web.jpg">We are hoping to locate sites that could be added to an existing ESA inventory,
      as listed below.&nbsp; Here are a few possibilities and links for further information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.goert.ca/">Garry Oak and associated ecosystems</a> </li>
        <li><a href="http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/theme_modules/wetlands/index.html">Seasonal or permanent wetlands</a> </li>
        <li><a href="../../environment/pdf/esa/Vernalpoolsandvernalseeps.pdf">Seeps and vernal (temporary) pools</a> </li>
        <li><a href="http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/library/documents/treebook/trees.htm">Arbutus stands, or trembling aspen groves</a> </li>

        <li><a href="http://www.crd.bc.ca/watersheds/protection/howtohelp/agriculture.htm">Modified habitat: hedgerows, barns, old fields</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Where do we hope to find new ESA&rsquo;s?</h2>
      <p>Saanich is particularly hoping to find new sites near parks which would help to buffer and add to natural areas.&nbsp; Undeveloped right-of-ways are also important because they can inform future land use.&nbsp; Villages and centres (see <a href="../../community/ocp/index.html">Official Community Plan</a>) are important as we expect to see increased density in the future and knowing where significant areas are in advance is useful.&nbsp; A balance between urban and rural sites, which are not already protected in some way, is also desired.&nbsp; </p>
      <h2>How will the information be used?</h2>
      <p>The information collected will be used to guide our biological consultant to areas that may be useful additions to our existing inventories and mapping.&nbsp; The consultant will consider our priorities, the condition of the site, and the scientific merit of including the site as a potential ESA.&nbsp; Recommendations will be considered to determine if the site is an ESA and if it should appear in one of our atlases.</p>
      <p><em><strong>The deadline for public submissions (Phase 1) has passed.</strong></em> The District of Saanich appreciates all submissions, however not all sites will be visited or considered for ESA potential for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; Sites will be weighed against set criteria and priorities.&nbsp; Some sites will be assessed by aerial photo interpretation.&nbsp; Some private land sites may not be accessible.&nbsp; For a summary of the methods and results of Phase 1, please see <a href="../../environment/pdf/esa/ESAMappingProjectHandout.pdf"><strong>the handout</strong></a> from the public presentation of July 10th.</p>
      <h2>What if my property is suggested as an ESA?</h2>
      <p>Both public and private property may be suggested as an ESA.&nbsp; If suggested, an ESA on your property will be weighed against scientific criteria and priorities.&nbsp; Our consultant may use aerial photographs to determine if the area is an ESA.&nbsp; If the consultant wishes to enter your property to gather more information, you will be contacted.&nbsp; Unless you give permission to the consultant, they will not proceed with gathering information on-site.&nbsp; After phase 2 is complete, staff and the consultant will work together to recommend additions to our atlases depending on the results of the data collection.&nbsp; Any land recommended for protection during future development would need to be adopted by Council which includes a Public Hearing.</p>
