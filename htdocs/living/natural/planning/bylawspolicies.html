      <h2>Environmental Protocol</h2>
      <p>In 2003, The Municipality of Saanich adopted a new protocol for working in and around environmentally sensitive areas.&nbsp; The protocol was an initiative of the Engineering Department and developed by the Interdepartmental Committee.</p>
      <p>Guidelines within the protocol ensure interdepartmental communication, increased environmental protection and will hopefully improve communication with the public.</p>
      <p>Two key aspects of the adoption of this protocol include mandatory training for all staff working in these areas and the right and responsibility of all staff to make sure that the protocol has been followed and to stop work if there are any concerns.</p>
      <p>For more information, read about the <a href="../../environment/pdf/enviroprotocol.pdf">Saanich Environmental Protocol </a>(PDF 11 KB).</p>
      <h2>Protecting the Environment</h2>
      <p>Before starting any work on your property in Saanich, find out more about the environmental bylaws, policies, inititatives and senior government requirements. If you are cutting down a tree, placing fill, clearing vegetation, stabilizing the banks of a creek or other activities that affect the natural environment, please find out if you require a permit.</p>
      <p>        For more information, read through the brochure:&nbsp; <a href="../../environment/pdf/protectenviro.pdf">Protecting the Environment in Saanich</a> (PDF 796 KB). The brochure is also available from the Planning Department.</p>
      <p>You can also protect our watercourses and ocean waters from pollution caused by house painting and power washing.&nbsp; Both professionals and homeowners will find the useful tips listed under the <a href="http://www.crd.bc.ca/watersheds/regulations.htm#bmp#bmp">CRD Best Management Practices.</a></p>
      <h2> Tree Preservation Bylaw </h2>
      <p> The Saanich Vision reflects the community commitment to the urban forest by preserving and protecting our native and significant trees. These trees provide much of the beauty and heritage that we recognize as important in preserving our environment and quality of life. </p>
      <p> The purpose of the Tree Preservation Bylaw is to prevent the unnecessary removal and damage of protected trees on all lands within the Municipality.</p>
      <p>Visit the <a href="../../../parkrec/parks/trees/bylaw.html">Parks page</a> for further information.</p>
      <h2>Noxious Weeds Bylaw</h2>
      <p> Through the Noxious Weeds Bylaw, property owners in the Municipality of Saanich can be required to remove &ldquo;bylaw listed&rdquo; noxious weeds, or any other invasive plants that are likely to spread or become a nuisance to other property in the vicinity. Invasive species are those that have been introduced from outside of their native region, and become a threat to local biological diversity, while Noxious Weed is a term primarily reserved for plant species that are capable of inflicting agricultural loss or ill health on people.</p>
      <p>The specifics of the bylaw can be found at <a href="../../pdf/weeds8080.pdf">Saanich Noxious Weed Bylaw</a>.</p>
      <h2>Pesticide Bylaw</h2>
      <p>The bylaw (adopted January 25, 2010) regulates that no person may apply or otherwise use pesticides for the purpose of maintaining outdoor trees, shrubs, flowers, other ornamental plants, and turf on private land or public land.&nbsp; Public land includes land owned by the municipality and private land means land used for residential purposes.</p>
      <p>There are exemptions to this bylaw as well as the potential to obtain a permit. <a href="../../environment/pdf/pesticide9054.pdf">View the bylaw in its entirety.</a></p>
