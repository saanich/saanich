      <h2>What is the Noxious Weeds Bylaw?</h2>
      <p>The Noxious Weeds Bylaw was first adopted by Saanich Council in 1906, the year the District of Saanich was incorporated.&nbsp; Three plants were named as Noxious Weeds:&nbsp; Canada Thistle, Ox-eye Daisy, and Wild Mustard.&nbsp; These plants are all considered agricultural weeds which leads us to believe the original bylaw was set in place to protect farming.&nbsp; The bylaw was clear in that these plants needed to be cut down before they seeded, &lsquo;eradicated&rsquo; from lands and &lsquo;destroyed&rsquo;.&nbsp; Neglectful landowners could be expected to pay a fine up to $20.00 and pay for the expense of their eradication.&nbsp; The <em>Noxious Weeds Bylaw</em> was signed by the first Reeve (Mayor) of Saanich, Thomas Brydon, who owned a farm named Craigo Park Farm in the area.</p>
      <p>Over time, the bylaw was updated to include new plant species that were also agricultural weeds, and eventually plants that were considered harmful to people and/or to the natural environment.&nbsp; Wording was changed and the bylaw title expanded.&nbsp; The current bylaw can be viewed here:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/living/pdf/weeds8080.pdf">http://www.saanich.ca/living/pdf/weeds8080.pdf</a></p>
      <p>For more information about Noxious Weeds and Invasive Species, please see our webpages:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/living/natural/invasives/index.html">http://www.saanich.ca/living/natural/invasives/index.html</a></p>
      <h2>Why does the Noxious Weeds Bylaw need to be updated?<img src="../../../images/living/env/isnw/bylawrev/Bylaw-Revision.jpg" alt="Noxious Weeds Bylaw Complaints 2012" width="290" height="234" hspace="20" align="left"></h2>
      <p>Originally crafted to protect farming, more than 100 years later the bylaw receives very few complaints about agricultural weeds&mdash;only 4% in 2012.&nbsp; By comparison, 61% of complaints received under the bylaw were regarding overgrown lawns, tall grasses, and weeds found in lawns such as Common Dandelions.&nbsp; These complaints are more related to aesthetics, concerns with attracting vermin and perceived fire risk.&nbsp; Thirty-four percent of complaints were about contemporary invasive species that are a risk to the environment.&nbsp; And finally, only 2% of complaints were about plants that are a concern for human health.&nbsp; This low number is reflective of the on-going success of the campaign to eradicate Giant Hogweed in Saanich.</p>
      <p>In summary, the Noxious Weeds Bylaw was written to protect agriculture but is now used mainly to control tall grasses and lacks clarity regarding invasive species, which are an increasing concern.&nbsp; An updated bylaw is needed that can be used effectively in combination with educational outreach for Saanich residents to address the problems of today.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>What is the Invasive Species Management Strategy?</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/parkrec/parks/natural/documents/InvasiveSpeciesManagementStrategyJuly11Final.pdf" target="_blank">Invasive Species Management Strategy</a> (ISMS)  was adopted by Saanich Council in April 2013.&nbsp; The goal of the ISMS is:</p>
      <p>To prevent establishment of new invasive species and reduce, control and mitigate the effects of established invasive species on natural ecosystems, human health and the economy. </p>
      <h3>The ISMS has four strategies:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Implement a comprehensive program</li>
        <li> Prevent the introduction and eradicate new invasive species</li>
        <li>Contain and control the spread of established invasive species</li>
        <li>Ensure program sustainability</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The ISMS recommends that the Noxious Weed Bylaw be amended, including consideration of the current <a href="http://www.coastalisc.com/regional-committees/crisp" target="_blank">Capital Region Invasive Species Program</a> (CRISP) regional plant list and management classifications:</p>
      <table width="700" border="0">
        <tr valign="middle">
          <td width="206"><h4>Management Classification</h4></td>
          <td width="484"> <h4>Description</h4></td>
        </tr>
        <tr valign="middle" bgcolor="#FF0000">
          <td><strong>Prevent</strong>&nbsp;</td>
          <td>Species not known to occur in the region, but likely to establish if introduced.&nbsp; Eradicate if found.&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr valign="middle" bgcolor="#FF6600">
          <td><strong>Eradicate</strong></td>
          <td>Species known to occur in limited distribution and low density.&nbsp; Eradicate if found.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr valign="middle" bgcolor="#FFFF00">
          <td><strong>Contain</strong></td>
          <td>Established infestations found in portions of the region. Contain existing infestations and prevent spread to un-infested areas.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr valign="middle" bgcolor="#33FF00">
          <td><strong>Control</strong></td>
          <td>Established infestations common and widespread throughout the Capital Region. Focus control in high value conservation areas. </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p><strong>The ISMS help to set priorities for efforts to contain and/or control the spread of established invasive species:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Presence of Species at Risk (Red and Blue Listed Species)</li>
        <li>Sensitive Ecosystems </li>
        <li>Riparian Areas and the Marine Backshore </li>
        <li>Areas of Community interest </li>
        <li> Best Management Practices</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The ISMS stresses the importance of communication, collaboration, education, training, disposal options, and restoration which will be important to consider when revising the Noxious Weeds Bylaw.</p>
      <p>The ISMS supports elevated response levels on private land for priority species and adjacent to natural areas and the continuation of inventorying high ecological value sites and invasive species on private land.&nbsp; The ISMS recommends exploring incentives for landowners to control and properly dispose of invasive species.</p>
      <h2>What are the objectives of the revision?<img src="../../../images/living/env/isnw/bylawrev/hogweed.jpg" alt="Giant Hogweed" width="400" height="265" hspace="20" align="right"></h2>
      <p><strong>The objectives of revising the Noxious Weeds Bylaw are:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>To broaden the bylaw to consider current issues such as:
          <ul>
            <li>new invasive species, such as <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/living/environment/pdf/invasive/knotweed-alert-web.pdf" target="_blank">Japanese Knotweed</a></li>
            <li>current agricultural weeds, such as <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/living/environment/pdf/invasive/blessed-alert-web.pdf" target="_blank">Blessed Milk Thistle</a></li>
            <li>established invasive species, such as <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/living/natural/pdf/Saanich_invas_Feb_2012.pdf" target="_blank">English Ivy</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.saanich.ca/living/natural/stewardship/naturescape.html" target="_blank">Naturescape gardening</a></li>
            <li>neglected properties </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>To align the bylaw with the goal, strategies and actions of the <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/parkrec/parks/natural/invasive.html" target="_blank">Invasive Species Management Strategy</a></li>
        <li>To update and align the bylaw with provincial legislation </li>
        <li>To increase the use of proper techniques for removal and disposal</li>
        <li>To address enforcement, compliance and administrative issues</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What is the process to change the Bylaw?</h2>
      <p>The process to revise the Bylaw is a two year initiative.&nbsp; In 2013, the goal is to identify issues and priorities, and obtain ideas from the general public and community groups.&nbsp; Research and consultation with Saanich departments and external agencies will occur at the same time.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>In 2014, the results of public input, research and consultation will be brought forward for discussion and feedback in the form of options and ideas for moving ahead.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Near the end of 2014, staff will bring forward a report to Council proposing revisions to the bylaw and a bylaw administration policy.&nbsp; There will be opportunities for further public input at the Committee of the Whole and Public Hearing meetings.&nbsp;</p>
