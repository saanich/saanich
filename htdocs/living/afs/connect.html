      <h3>Saanich Parks Horticulture continues Urban Agriculture</h3>
      <p><em>Kelly Mulhern, Saanich Parks Horticulture</em></p>
<img src="../../images/living/afs/gorge_garden_truck.jpg" class="float-left">
      <p> In 2010 Saanich Park&rsquo;s Horticulture staff took the initiative of incorporating edibles into a few locations in the municipality. The most notable, Gorge Waterway Park, next to the playground, and the Municipal Hall planters in Middleton Plaza (at the entrance to the Hall from the parking lot.) </p>
      <p> At the Gorge, vegetables included corn, scarlet runner beans, tomatoes, pumpkins, cucumbers, sunflowers and even a banana! Hand made signs were produced for each plant which added to the charm, and hopefully the children who visited the playground got a chance to see how their vegetables are grown, while enjoying a snack at the same time.</p>
      <p> At the Municipal Hall we planted tomatoes and a selection of herbs in the planters which typically would have flowers. We replaced some of the hanging baskets with baskets of juicy strawberries cascading down. In 2011, we added a vegetable patch at the entrance to the Municipal Hall off Darwin Ave. </p>
      <p> For the 2012 season, we have continued the tradition and have again planted the playground bed at the Gorge Waterway and the planters on Middleton Plaza at the Municipal Hall. Unfortunately, due to a large construction project in the parking lot we were unable to plant the bed at the entrance off Darwin.</p>
      <p>Once our crops start producing, we encourage the public and staff to share in the harvest and perhaps start an edible plot in their garden or a planter filled with veggies of their own. </p>
