<h3>Genetically Engineered (GE) Crops:</h3>
<p>At the April 14, 2013 AGM of the Association of Vancouver Island Coastal Communities (AVICC), Resolution 10 was passed with overwhelming support, to declare Vancouver Island a GE FREE Zone. &nbsp;&nbsp;PAC does not support GMO crops and in particular suggests that there should be a focus on what can be done to stop GMO seeds from coming the Island. &nbsp;Below is the full text of AVICC Resolution 10, April 14, 2013. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Whereas some Genetically Engineered (GE) crops, through pollination, can disperse their pollen and genes indiscriminately and potentially contaminate non-GE crops, resulting in lawsuits, loss of organic certification, and marketability and;</p>
  <p>Whereas there is particular concern with the transfer of DNA between species and the potential unintended consequences, especially with animal species and; </p>
  <p>Whereas Vancouver Island and associated Coastal Communities are isolated from other agricultural areas in British Columbia, which can provide practical approaches to avoiding contamination by GE organisms and these locations suggest that there is an opportunity for local farmers to provide organic production, to help maintain long-term sustainability, to foster a living seed bank, and to be a refuge from genetically engineered contamination; </p>
  <p>Therefore be it resolved that AVICC ask the British Columbia government to promote a prohibition on importing, exporting and growing of genetically engineered (GE) plants and seeds, and on raising of GE animals or other genetically engineered organisms, on Vancouver Island and associated Coastal Communities and in the marine waters nearby; and take action to implement, in the area encompassed by AVICC, a GE Free area with respect to all plant and animal species.</p>

Mike Doehnel - Growing grains for Sourdough and Suds; <br>
everything we need is right here </h3>
<p><img src="../../images/living/afs/grain_small.jpg" alt="" class="float-right">Historically, cereal grains have been successfully cultivated from Victoria through to Courtenay. Grains grown in rotation to other crops or used as cover crop are both important in maintaining soil health and breaking disease cycles. Over the past 10 years, grains have had a mini revival with a local focus on high quality bread and beer brewed at mini-breweries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come and hear Mike discuss his grain farming trials and tribulations and his 15 years of experience getting barley, wheat and oats back on the Saanich Peninsula agricultural map.</p>

<p>Nicky and Norman Wylie have raised chickens on their small peninsula farm for 30 years, experimenting with many different breeds, learning through experience what works and what doesn&rsquo;t. Nicky&rsquo;s workshop will help you bring food production to a personal level and as she says, &ldquo;we are what we eat&rdquo;.      </p>
