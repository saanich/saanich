      <p>Community Gardens can offer residents a place to socialize; a place to get fresh air and exercise; a place to feel accomplishment; and most importantly a place to grow their own food.&nbsp; Community Gardens are important tools towards success in reducing our carbon foot print by allowing those who choose to live in urban areas the opportunity to spend some time working with nature and by growing food they reduce their reliance on transported produce.</p>

      <h2>Community Gardens Policy </h2>
      <p><strong>Saanich Policy defines a &ldquo;community garden&rdquo; as a site operated by
      volunteers and: </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Used for the production of produce for the personal use </li>
        <li>Where instructional programming may be offered </li>
        <li> Where plots and services are provided to members in exchange for a fee. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="http://www.saanich.ca/living/pdf/communitygardenspolicy.pdf" target="_blank">Saanich&rsquo;s Community Garden Policy</a> recognizes the need for community gardens and outlines ways that the Municipality will support existing gardens and the establishment of future community gardens.</p>

      <h2> New Community Gardens being planned!</h2>
      <p>The Parks and Recreation Department have been working&nbsp;with&nbsp;two community groups to&nbsp;explore the possibility of establishing two new community garden sites, one in Gorge Park and one behind Saanich Commonwealth Place.&nbsp; An update on progress was recently provided by staff to Chair Gerrard&nbsp;and the Parks, Trails and Recreation Committee.</p>
      <p>Staff will be undertaking consultations with the community in both areas&nbsp; in the near future and should there be support for these potential sites, work will continue towards establishing operating agreements with local groups interested in operating the garden sites. Further information can be found on the <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/parkrec/parks/projects/current/newcommunitygardens.html" target="_blank">Parks page here</a>. </p>
      <p>Community gardens have existed in Saanich  for over 30 years.&nbsp; These two community gardens are further supported by the District of Saanich with water supply and road access.&nbsp; The gardens are managed by separate community groups as listed below.      </p>
