      <p>Farmers in all regions of the world struggle with environmental issues such as soil health, including depletion of nutrients in the soil and contamination of soil; soil erosion; water sources; drought; flooding; availability of services, including storage and processing facilities.</p>
      <p>The District of Saanich can address these issues with the implementation of various strategies and policies to support local food production.&nbsp; Such support includes strategies for the management of waste and livestock to reduce impacts on the watersheds; protection and restoration of natural water courses to control flooding; control and removal of invasive species. </p>
      <p>The Capital Regional District and the Capital Region Food and Agriculture Initiatives Roundtable (CRFAIR), the District of Saanich and other municipalities are working with the Province, food producers, the Vancouver Island Health Authority, and other stakeholders to develop a long-term plan for improving local and regional food security.&nbsp; Policies developed will be included in the Capital Regional Sustainability Strategy. </p>
      <p>The Saanich Official Community Plan policies address areas where Saanich supports environmentally sensitive agricultural practices.</p>

      <h2>Local Initiatives</h2><h3>Two District of Saanich Environmental Awards go to food producers
      </h3>
      <p>The District of Saanich <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/living/natural/enviro_awards.html">recognizes people and organizations</a> that make a positive contribution to the natural environment.&nbsp; In 2011, Robin Tunnicliffe, co-owner of <a href="http://www.saanichorganics.com/">Saanich Organics</a>, received an award for her efforts in sustainable food production and food access within our community; and Ray &amp; Judy Galey, owners of Galey Farms, were recognized for their efforts in Garry Oak Ecosystem conservation on their farmland.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>In 2001, Galey Farms, in partnership with Swan Lake and the District of Saanich, restored a section of upper Blenkinsop Creek with the design services of Aqua-Tex Scientific Consulting Ltd.&nbsp; This project was the winner of the 2002 FCM-CH2M Hill Environmental Award - the top ecological award in Canada. &nbsp;The streamside restoration has been a great benefit to the natural habitat and is a good example of agriculture producers working with the land and ecosystem to improve water quality, resource management, and integrated pest management.&nbsp; Visit the <a href="http://www.galeyfarms.net/default.aspx?PageID=1012">Galey Farms website</a> for more information.</p><h3>Haliburton Farms Biodiversity Project
      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://haliburtonfarm.org/wp/environmental-stewardship/urban-biodiversity-project" target="_blank">Haliburton Farm</a> is a Municipally owned property run by small scale organic farmers that work to grow agricultural products in a manner that is compatible with maintaining and restoring ecosystem health.&nbsp; In 2007, an Urban Biodiversity Project was initiated at Haliburton by volunteers from the School of Environmental Studies, University of Victoria. &nbsp;Projects that this group have worked on include building and installing bird boxes, bat boxes, mason bee boxes, salamander boards and snake cairns. They also restored the wetland on the Farm with the volunteer help of the Victoria Natural History Society, Habitat Conservation Trust, TD Friends of the Environment, the District of Saanich, the Land Conservancy, Copley Brothers Construction and BC Ministry of the Environment. </p>
      <h2>Provincial Government Initiatives</h2><h3>BC Environmental Farm Plan Program
      </h3>
      <p>The Environmental Farm Planning Program is designed to assist producers in developing an environmental action plan for their farm.&nbsp; The program is set up to enhance our natural resources and reduce the possibility of accidental harm to soil, air, water and biodiversity values.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>The Canada &ndash; British Columbia Environmental Farm Plan and Beneficial Management Practices Programs are a joint program funded in cooperation with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, B.C. Ministry of Agriculture and ARDCorp. </p><h3>ARDCorp BC Agricultural Research &amp; Development Corporation
      </h3>
      <p>Delivers programs and services to BC's primary agriculture industry.&nbsp; Visit their web site for a program overview of the <a href="http://www.ardcorp.ca/index.php?page_id=40">Province's Environmental Farm Plan program</a>.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>A report prepared by ARDCorp &quot;<a href="docs/EFPSuccessStoriesBrochure.pdf" target="_blank">Chronicles from BC&nbsp; Producers</a>&quot;, explains the program as follows:</p>
      <p><em>&ldquo;Environmental farm planning is a no charge, confidential, voluntary process available to producers to identify both environmental strengths and potential risks on their farms.</em></p>
      <p><em>Completing an EFP will provide farmers and ranchers with an understanding of agriculturally related environmental regulations and of farm management practices that enhance environmental values.&nbsp; In many cases the outcome of improved water and nutrient management will also be profitable. Protecting riparian areas can improve water quality as well as enhancing fish and wildlife habitat.&nbsp; A decision to do an EFP will bring positive recognition to individual producers and the industry.&rdquo;</em></p><h3>BC Ministry of Agriculture
      </h3>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.gov.bc.ca/agri/">BC Ministry of Agriculture</a> provides guides and factsheets to guide farmers in a variety of environmentally sensitive agricultural management practices:</p>
