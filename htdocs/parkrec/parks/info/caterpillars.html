         </h2>
      <p>Tent caterpillars are the larvae of certain moths that are native to western North and Central America. They hatch from eggs in early spring when <img src="images/TentCaterpillar5_000.jpg" alt="tent caterpillars" width="300" height="200" align="right">the leaves of their host plants are just unfolding. Many people are familiar with their distinct orange and black bodies. Western tent caterpillars prefer alder, apple, ash, birch, cherry, cottonwood, willow, Garry oak, domestic fruit trees, and roses.</p>
      <p>Their tents are constructed in locations that get the morning sun, which the caterpillars need to warm their bodies.</p>
      <p>As they mature, they begin to forage for food, either en masse or singly. Immediately after feeding they return to the tent and aggregate in sunlight to speed up their digestion. They expel about 50% of what they eat as undigested plant material. </p><h2>How long will they be around?
      </h2>
      <p>Caterpillars grow rapidly and usually complete their larval life cycle in seven to eight weeks. Around mid-June, they will crawl away from their natal tree and seek a protected place in plants, under leaves, or on structures to attach and spin their cocoons. The adult moths emerge about 7 to 10 days later. </p>
      <p>The moths are stout-bodied and light brown. They often fly in clusters around street or porch lights on summer evenings. After the moths mate, the females lay 100 to 350 eggs in a froth-covered band around small twigs or branches of host trees. The eggs mature in three weeks but do not hatch until the following spring.</p><h2>What good are they?
      </h2>
      <p>Tent caterpillars offer many benefits, even during an outbreak. Although caterpillars are distasteful to most birds, some birds feed on them. When tree branches are defoliated, the plants below receive increased sunlight, giving some of them a boost in growth. The tiny pellets the caterpillars expel break down easily, returning nutrients to the soil. If you listen carefully below a colony you will hear the tiny pellets hitting the ground. The pupae (the stage just before the adult) provide nutritious meals for small mammals. The moths are eaten by birds and bats. </p><h2>Why are there so many this year?
      </h2>
      <p>Tent caterpillars follow a boom-or-bust population cycle. Some say the cycle in our region is about seven years, although this varies depending on weather and other factors. We had a mild winter, so there were fewer egg losses due to cold. As a result, there are a lot more tents and caterpillars than usual.</p>
      <h2>Will they kill my tree?
      </h2>
      <p>In most cases, no. Tent caterpillars defoliate (eat the leaves of) the branch their tent is on, but once they vacate the tent, the branch will usually grow new leaves. This does not affect the overall health of the tree.</p>
      <p>Healthy ornamental trees and shrubs should survive even serious defoliation. However, trees that have been under stress (excess cold, heat, crowding, drought, flooding, etc.) may succumb and require more protection. </p>
      <p>Where trees are crowded or stressed, the defoliation could be a life and death matter. While healthy trees will leaf out again, weak trees may die. In a natural setting, surviving trees can thrive in the absence of competition. </p>
      <p>In boom years, there might be many tents on one tree. </p><h2>Should I get rid of them and how?
      </h2>
      <p>Tent caterpillars are a short-term nuisance in some locations. If you want to get rid of them, the simplest way is to remove and destroy the larvae and their nests by stripping or pruning them from branches.</p>
      <p>You can cut off the branch, bag it and leave it in the shade. The caterpillars will die and you can add all the material, including the carcasses, to your compost. You can also dispose of the branch, tent and all in the Saanich Yard Waste facility at Borden and McKenzie.</p>
      <p>Evening and early morning are the best times to prune because tent caterpillars tend to congregate in their nests at night.</p>
      <p>Burning the nests, a traditional method of control, is not appropriate because of the fire hazard and smoke. </p>
      <p>Now that Saanich's pesticide by-law is in place, spraying with synthetic pesticides to kill tent caterpillars is not permitted. The kurstaki variety of Bacillus thuringiensis (known as Btk) can be used without a permit, but please be aware that Btk is not selective, meaning that it will kill the larvae of any moth or butterfly that eats it. For more information about Btk, please go to the BC Ministry of Forests and Range webpage at</p>

      <p>Saanich does not prune or remove branches with tent caterpillar nests.</p>
