      Ring that Bell &ndash; Confessions of a New Commuter Cyclist</h2>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">As we approach the annual Bike to Work Week (BTWW), I thought it was a good time to reflect on my last year as a new commuter cyclist.&nbsp; For the 10 years that I have been with Saanich Parks, I have always participated in BTWW. Then as soon as it was over I&rsquo;d return to my car. You see, Saanich requires me to provide my own transportation for business. So my excuse was &ldquo;I need my car for my job&rdquo;. But last year, I decided to keep riding. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">Over the past year I have learned a great deal of things. Some has been about me &amp; some about trail use/users. I have also rediscovered connections to my youth &amp; the environment. I also learned that it can really rain here but you dry out (eventually).</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">For better or worse, here is my list of what I have learned:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Great trail system -</strong> OK I already knew that &amp; it&rsquo;s my job to say that but its true. We have over 100 km of trails in Saanich. The access to the CRD Galloping Goose &amp; Lochside Trail as spines to our system is fantastic. I am lucky that for my commute I use off road trails for almost all of it. </li>
        <li><strong>It&rsquo;s Social</strong> &ndash; The use of our trails for both commuting and recreation is a social activity. People walk 2 abreast or cycle side by side to socialize. They are talking about their day, their plans, the weather or what ever but it&rsquo;s a social experience. However, on bike or foot, when you pass others adjust to single file. 1 trail user going in each direction at the same time makes it easy &amp; comfortable for all </li>
        <li><strong>I love it</strong> &ndash; I enjoy my ride to &amp; from work; even in the rain. When I started I resisted buying a bunch of stuff &amp;/or spending a lot of money. The rack &amp; panniers were a good investment. Plus I&rsquo;ve even dropped a few pounds &amp; feel better.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy the ride</strong> &ndash; The commute offers me a chance to see things to smell things &amp; enjoy things I never really could in the car. The micro-climate of the cool wind coming down the Lochside Trail to the Switch Bridge or the view of the Olympic Mtns on a clear day makes the ride enjoyable too. </li>
        <li><strong>Share the Trail Saanich</strong> &ndash; It&rsquo;s our trail etiquette campaign &amp; we need to keep getting this message out. &nbsp;To &lsquo;share&rsquo; means we all have a right to use &amp; enjoy the trail. A few simple, common-sense considerations will make your trail-travel safer and more enjoyable for everyone. Show consideration for others. </li>
        <li><strong>Are you a car, a bike or what?</strong> &ndash; Drivers get frustrated when a cyclist switches about who they are as cyclists. Sometimes cyclists act like cars the next moment they are on the sidewalk like a pedestrian. I can see why some drivers get angry. </li>
        <li><strong style="text-align:justify;">Keep right (except to pass)</strong> &ndash; We want everyone to do this. A multi-use trail is not a road &amp; we don&rsquo;t want pedestrians walking on the left facing the oncoming traffic. If everyone did this we&rsquo;d end up with 4 abreast in 2 directions on each side of the trail. &nbsp;If folks keep right, warn others when they pass we can all share.</li>
        <li><strong>Warn others when passing</strong>&ndash; I don&rsquo;t know how many times I&rsquo;ve been passed by someone (either when I&rsquo;m on bike or when walking) whizzing by in silence. Just give us a friendly warning so we know you are there &amp; passing, no surprises. By the way, the warning is not meant to signal &ldquo;clear the deck I&rsquo;m coming through&rdquo; nor does it mean pedestrians need to jump out of the way. It should be made early enough that all can adjust &amp; continue to enjoy the trail.</li>
        <li><strong>        Slow down</strong> &ndash; Control your speed, &amp; yield to slower users. &nbsp;Some of the conflict on the trails exists from the speed of some cyclists. Don&rsquo;t sweat; enjoy the view. </li>
        <li><strong>Control &amp; clean up after your pet</strong> &ndash; Pets are an important part of people lives. Walking your dog on the trail is a very legitimate trail use. But I know that I always feel safer with a leashed dogs but those retractable leashes aren&rsquo;t very good if the owner is on 1 side &amp; the dog is in the ditch on the other. Remember dog droppings aren&rsquo;t fun for anyone on the trails. Some parks/trails have leash regulations so be sure to check. <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/parkrec/parks/parks/dog.html">http://www.saanich.ca/parkrec/parks/parks/dog.html</a> </li>
        <li><strong>Be Seen &ndash; </strong>Lights, bright colours, reflectors all help trail users see each other. This goes for cyclists as well as pedestrians. I know in the dark winter months I have come upon many pedestrians that I could not see until my headlight showed me their outline. But those that have a light or a reflector I can spot well before the close call.<strong></strong>
        </li>
        <li><strong style="text-align:justify;">Respect &ndash; </strong>The environment and neighbours, keep to the trail.Maybe this is really a key message just like SHARE. If we RESPECT that everyone has a right to the trail maybe it&rsquo;s that much easier to SHARE.<strong> </strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">I have really enjoyed my first year as a commuter cyclist &amp; plan to continue. I&rsquo;d love to hear about your experiences &amp; opinions on my observations as well as our Share the Trail Saanich program. Look for us at the Saanich Hall Celebration Station during BTWW again this year.</p>

      Signs, Signs everywhere a Sign</h2>
      <p>For the past 13 years or so, Saanich Parks has been quietly providing park interpretation through the use of illustrative information signs at key locations throughout the parks system. Currently there are over 50 interpretive &amp; directional signs in our inventory. Over the past few years, these initiatives have been highlighted by Council in the Strategic Plan. Some recent parks additions include: Doris Page, Harvest Lane, Browning, Mount Douglas &amp; Gorge parks. We have just completed the installation of directional signs along the Colquitz River Trail to help guide park users.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">The emphasis on growing our inventory of signs continues. We will be enhancing trail signage &amp; installing a number of heritage &amp; natural history interpretive signs. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">We have also recently created a web presence for our Interpretive Signs. So even if you can&rsquo;t get out there or once you&rsquo;ve seen it in the park you can review the information on line.</p>

      <h2>December, 2012<br>
      Looking back; looking forward</h2>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">Each year we like to pause &amp; think about what we have accomplished. Sometimes its sort of a &lsquo;what did we do again&rsquo; but usually its wow we did all that. </p>
      <h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2012 highlights:</strong></h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Pulling Together &ndash; </strong>Our natural area management program continues to grow. The work we are able to do removing invasive species &amp; restoring our natural parks<strong> </strong>is fantastic. Our program has grown to over<strong> </strong>40 active sites with over 100 registered volunteers.&nbsp; We also have up to 500+ on special projects. </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.saanich.ca/parkrec/parks/natural/index.html">http://www.saanich.ca/parkrec/parks/natural/index.html</a></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Mount</strong><strong> View Park -</strong>&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;</strong>This Park was created by the development of the former Mt View School site at 3814 Carey Road (now referred to as Mount View Heights). It is .54 ha (1.33 acres) in size, and is located in the Carey Local Area. The park includes unstructured open space, a playground and picnic area, a seating plaza with shrub and perennial beds, naturalistic features, trees, and pedestrian circulation links. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://www.saanich.ca/parkrec/parks/projects/current/mtcarey.html">http://www.saanich.ca/parkrec/parks/projects/current/mtcarey.html</a></p>

Currently there are 27 interpretive signs along Saanich trails and in Saanich Parks. Over the past few years, these initiatives have been highlighted in the Strategic Plan. Some recent parks additions include: Doris Page, Harvest Lane, Browning, Mount Douglas &amp; Gorge.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Mount</strong><strong> Douglas</strong><strong> Park &ndash;</strong> This year we undertook a number of projects to improve &amp; enhance the park. We also celebrated the 20th Anniversary of the park&rsquo;s title transfer to Saanich </p>

      <p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Urban Forestry &ndash; </strong>we completed the canopy cover analysis, we have increased our tree planting efforts &amp; begun to work on the next steps of the implementation of the Urban Forest Strategy.<strong></strong></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://www.saanich.ca/parkrec/parks/trees/index.html">http://www.saanich.ca/parkrec/parks/trees/index.html</a></p>
      <p><strong>Hall Landscape - </strong>We are renovated &amp; transitioned the bent grass (putting green) lawns to a more traditional/residential lawn, predominantly perennial ryegrass. We also converted some annual beds to shrub beds or residential grade lawn. We introduced edible vegetables and fruits into the landscape reduced the amount of high maintenance ornamental plants &amp; planted more native plants. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Community Recreation Grant</strong> &ndash; we were successful in receiving a grant of $337,500 to help improve beach accessibility &amp; to create a new accessible for all playground for Cadboro-Gyro Park. We will finish the planning process &amp; then undertake the work by March31, 2015</p>
      <h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2013 priorities:</strong></h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Planning projects &ndash;</strong> we have a number of major park planning &amp; design projects underway. They include: Cuthbert Holmes Park, Cadboro-Gyro Park, proposed Clay Courts, proposed new community gardens &amp; Panama Flats.</p>

      <h2>Movember 2, 2012<br>
        Fall Colours, Coho &amp; Mo Bros</h2>
      <p>What a show, the fall colours are in full swing. The cool weather has helped to bring on a fantastic show.      </p>
      <p><img src="images/tree010.jpg" class="float-left" alt="fall colours" width="300" height="400">Our parks and trails are a great place to enjoy the show. The Big Leaf maples drop such a grand leaf. They are so much fun to walk through. Shelbourne and the London Planes create a nice canopy. I&rsquo;d love to see and/or hear from people about their favorite or best place to see the colours and enjoy some fall outdoor recreation.</p>
      <p>Fall colours also mean the annual returning salmon. The coho run in the Colquitz is reported to be higher than normal. Chris Bos and all the dedicated volunteers have counted nearly 450 fish compared to only 58 last year at this time. </p>
      <p>A link to the Times Colonist article is below:</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.timescolonist.com/news/Despite+spills+Colquitz+coho+return+above+average/7487925/story.html">http://www.timescolonist.com/news/Despite+spills+Colquitz+coho+return+above+average/7487925/story.html</a></p>
      <p>We are also proud to be partnering with Peninsula Streams and the Swan Lake Christmas Hill Nature Sanctuary on a Swan Creek Stewardship project. A follow up meeting will be held Tuesday, November 6th, 7 p.m. in the Owen Room at Pearkes Recreation Centre</p>
      <p>November also brings the annual Mo Grow. Movember and Sons is the theme and growing awareness for prostate cancer. Saanich Parks has been participating for the past few years and we have a good group of Mo Bros again. Some first timers and some that have shaven clean for the first time in a long while to re-start for the cause. So if you see some hairy lips on our staff say hey to the Mo Bro.</p>

      <h2>September 21, 2012<br>
        Changing Seasons </h2>
      <p>As fall approaches our programs &amp; priorities change.</p>
      <p>However, the following is a list of some of our current activities &amp; successes:</p>
      <p><strong>Majestic</strong><strong> Park</strong><strong> &ndash; </strong>The old play equipment&nbsp;is being&nbsp;replaced with&nbsp;a new playground with an emphasis on accessibility and inclusiveness. Work will begin in late September, including planting shade trees, new furniture, and improvements to drainage and pathways.<strong> </strong></p>
      <p><a href="http://saanich.ca/parkrec/parks/projects/current/majestic.html">http://saanich.ca/parkrec/parks/projects/current/majestic.html</a></p>
      <p><strong>Whitehead</strong><strong> Park</strong><strong> &ndash; </strong>While it received a bit of a mixed reaction the new multi-purpose dock indicated in the approved Park Concept Plan has been installed, and will complement the new playground, trails, and riparian restoration work done in the last 2 years. All permits have been secured, and the dock&nbsp;was installed under the supervision of a Qualified Environmental Professional to ensure no negative impacts to the environment result. Additionally this summer, parks staff with the help of some volunteers at removed the invasive Yellow Flag Iris. Over 120 square metres of iris were removed from the park shoreline. This was a&nbsp;difficult work as the rhizomes&nbsp;needed to be hand dug and removed to a compost facility. The area has now been covered with coco mat and reseeded with fall rye to control erosion.</p>
      <p><img src="../../../images/dock.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="333">&nbsp; <img src="../../../images/dock1.JPG" alt="" width="250" height="333"></p>
      <p>The dock&nbsp;will enhance general recreation by increasing access to the lake for wading and viewing, and allow easy launching for carry-in watercraft.</p>
      <p><strong>Interpretive Signs &ndash; </strong>In partnership with the Saanich Volunteer Services Society, the interpretive sign and notice board was installed for their September 20th anniversary celebration. One side of the kiosk includes a map of Cedar Hill Park and Golf Course including the McCrae House. The other side of the kiosk is a notice board for the Society.</p>
      <p>In partnership with the Gorge Tillicum Community Association, an interpretive sign will be installed by mid October at Gorge Park that talks about the history of the park and Gorge Waterway.</p>
      <p>Completed signs to date include the Camosun Community Association notice board and map at Browning Park, the heritage interpretive sign at Doris Page Park and the map sign at Harvest Lane Park.</p>
      <p><strong>Directional Signs - </strong>Directional route marking signs will be installed this fall along the Colquitz River Trail from Gorge Road at Dysart through to Lindsay Street adjacent to Brydon Park. As the Colquitz River Trail is part of the Centennial Trail family of trails &ndash; it will be marked with the same style of sign.<strong> </strong>Staff are also currently working on updating all the small map kiosks throughout Mt Douglas Park with additional large kiosks to be placed at the parking lot locations.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Blenkinsop Trailhead - </strong>Parking lot construction is well underway with paving scheduled for September. Paving for this 9-car parking lot will be with permeable asphalt. A bike rack, interpretive sign and map will also be installed at the trail head. Staff have worked closely with a Garry oak ecosystem biologist and the Friends of Mount Douglas Park to select the trail route that will lead up from the parking lot to a fantastic viewpoint and then lead further into the park where it will meet with the Tod Trail. The trail will be approximately 450m in length and will be marked a black diamond route (most difficult). The Mercer Trail head at Blenkinsop Road will remain although de-emphasized by relocating the Mt Douglas Park sign to the entrance of the new parking area.</p>
      <p><img src="../../../images/blenkinsop1.JPG" alt="" width="200" height="267"><img src="../../../images/blenkinsop2.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="267"><img src="../../../images/blenkinsop3.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="267"><img src="../../../images/blenkinsop4.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="267"></p>
      <p><strong>Douglas</strong><strong> Creek Restoration</strong> &ndash; In May of 2012 Saanich Parks hired D.R. Clough Consulting to conduct a habitat and riparian assessment for Douglas Creek. We now have a five year plan to restore fish habitat. In late August and early September Parks staff along with consultant implemented the prescribed recommendations for the creek below Ash road. We have also repaired some small tributaries within the park which have been depositing silt within the creek. Work will continue for the next five years to fully implement the plan. </p>
      <p><strong>Clay Courts - </strong>Earlier this year the District of Saanich was contacted by a not for profit group called the Cedar Hill Clay Court Tennis Society to discuss the possibility of installing an outdoor clay court tennis facility.&nbsp; The proposed location is on the north side of the Cedar Hill Recreation Centre in Cedar Hill Park. The society has met with key community groups, attended local events and had ongoing discussions with Saanich Parks and Recreation staff to explain the proposal and to learn about key issues associated with the proposed facility. </p>
      <p>The Society, which would fund the facility, has collected some community feedback that has been considered into the design of the facility. The Society would now like to move forward with its proposal. Saanich Parks and Recreation staff will be hosting an open house on October 2nd to obtain public feedback on the proposal.</p>

        Summer Fun</h2>
      <p> Since that dreadful month of Junuary, we have finally had a bit of summer to enjoy. In Saanich, our summer fun includes days at the beach, long bike rides, gardening and nights in the backyard enjoying the stars and the moon. But this past weekend, Aug 12th, Saanich was host to 2 great summer celebrations.</p>
      <p>This year a new summer fun event was created, the Gorge Swim Fest. The history of recreating in and on the waterway goes back to the turn of the century. The first swimming lessons were taught there. They also held high diving competitions. A number of Community Associations got together to create an event to celebrate the years of community effort to improve the waterway. The Swim Fest was well attended and many (including myself) enjoyed a refreshing dip in the water.</p>
      <p><img src="../../../images/GorgeDock1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400"></p>
      <p>The Cadboro Bay Festival at Cadboro-Gyro Park also celebrated summer. The ever growing sand sculpture contest is making the Festival a signature event for not only Saanich but the region. Lots for families, music, food and community displays. </p>
      <p><img src="../../../images/CBFest2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224"></p>
      <p>Congratulations to the organizers, volunteers &amp; sponsors of both of these events.</p>
      <p> There is also one last night of Music in the Park, Tuesday Aug 21 at Rutledge Park starting 6pm.</p>
      <p>So get out enjoy what is left of summer and let&rsquo;s hope September brings warmer days to stretch out our summer fun a bit longer.</p>

      <h2>July 5, 2012<br>
SOS Parks   &ndash; Share our Saanich Parks</h2>
      <p>Not to be confused with save our souls but <strong>Share our Saanich Parks</strong> is a concept I have been &lsquo;bugging&rsquo; the staff about over the past few weeks.</p>
      <p>What do I mean by that? We ask people to Share the Trail, we want to share information, we ask users to share spaces in parks tax payers feel they own a share of their parks. There are lots of ways this concept of SHARING can apply. I actually want it to be all of this &amp; more!</p>
      <p>Many years ago I read a book by Robert Fulghurn, All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten. I remember that part of this book mentions sharing. I was surprised to be reminded that the #1 thing he says he learned was: Share everything. The rest of the list, 14 in all, is pretty good too. One was also about to Live a balanced life. </p>
      <p>The Oxford dictionary states that <strong>share</strong> can be used as a noun or a verb:</p>
      <p>Noun - part or portion of a larger amount which is divided among a number of people, or to which a number of people contribute.<br>
        Verb - have a portion of (something) with another or others.<br>
        Oxford state that <strong>balanced </strong>is an adjective: keeping or showing a balance; in good proportions. </p>
      <p>So based on these concepts &amp; definitions; the ideal of sharing our balanced park system has admirable. We have nearly 170 parks, 800+ Ha of land, 99 km of trails, 35 tennis court, 62 sports fields, 56 playgrounds plus lawn bowling, allotment gardens, a water Park, a skate park, 2 lacrosse boxes &amp; more. Seems like we have more than enough parks &amp; space to share right?</p>
      <p>Seems we spend a lot of time talking to people about sharing. We seem to meet challenges when these concepts of sharing or balance come into play. I am reminded of what someone said recently that &lsquo;depending on what seat you&rsquo;re in&rsquo; can affect your perception about sharing or what the balance should be.</p>
      <p>Finding that balance to share is a big part of what we do. How do we do it? We talk to people. We undertake planning exercises. We do surveys. We hold Open Houses. We post notices. We write blogs. We follow the OCP &amp; Strategic Plans. We develop Parks, Recreation &amp; Culture Master Plans.</p>
      <p>This Master Plan goes to Council on July 9. It&rsquo;s to give us direction on the next 5-7 years. We believe that it will help us continue our work to share a balanced park system. </p>

      <p>However, for the record, our actual revised draft Mission for the Department is</p>
      <p><strong><em>Working in partnership with the community, we create opportunities to enrich the community, sustain quality environments, and support healthy lifestyles.</em></strong></p>
      <p>I&rsquo;m interested in your comments on this concept of <strong>SOS Parks &ndash; Share our Saanich Parks</strong></p>

      <h2>May 25, 2012<br>
      What&rsquo;s UP?</h2>
<p>I get asked all the time, what are your guys doing or better yet, must be busy!&nbsp; The answer is yes, we are busy and we have lots of great things going on that I&rsquo;d like to share.</p>
<p><strong>Majestic Park </strong></p>
      <p>A list of suggested play equipment and related furniture is posted on the web for comment. Staff expects to put out an RFP in May, with playground installation planned after school summer holidays.</p>
      <p><strong>Mount View Park</strong></p>
      <p>The road-narrowing related works in the Homer Road right of way along with the trail and entrance hub are nearing completion.</p>
      <p><strong>Interpretive Signs</strong></p>
      <p>Parks has installed a Community Notice Board for the Camosun Community Association and it is already in use. The backside of the notice board has the parks and trails map with the Camosun Community Association&rsquo;s boundary highlighted. The Doris Page Park sign will be installed by the end of April and the Harvest Lane Park map signs will be installed once the paving is complete. Work continues on an interpretive sign and map for McMorran Park and Gorge Park.</p>
      <p><strong>Mt. Douglas Park - Blenkinsop Road Parking Lot and Trail Head </strong></p>
      <p>Preparations continue to construct the nine car parking lot on Blenkinsop Road in the spring with trail improvements to follow in the summer. Final trail routing will be determined in early May after mapping of the spring flowers is complete. The parking area will be complete with a bike rack, habitat and trail map and garbage can. The lot will be signed and gated.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Whitehead Park Dock</strong></p>
      <p>Consistent with the approved concept plan for the park, we are proceeding with a water access dock at the park. Installation is still planned for this year&rsquo;s Department of Fisheries and Oceancs &lsquo;fisheries window&rsquo; June 15 &ndash; Sept 15.</p>
      <p><strong>Rainbow Park</strong></p>
      <p>The trail connections through the park are nearing completion. It is part of the North Douglas Connector and will help serve the community with improved north south connectivity.</p>
      <p><strong>Pulling Together Volunteer Program</strong></p>
      <p>We have 40+ sites and over 100 registered volunteers. We estimate nearly 500 people participate in the natural area restoration program annually. Follow the link to find our current events <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/living/natural/opportunities.html">http://www.saanich.ca/living/natural/opportunities.html</a></p>
      <p><strong>Outerbridge Park </strong></p>
      <p>The partnership with the Horticulture Centre of the Pacific (HCP) and Mrs. Outerbridge herself continues to flourish. During a recent site visit from Mrs. Outerbridge she met our key staff who led the parks transformation with the restored trails and the new parking area/trailhead. She also met and shared stories with the HCP volunteers who have achieved so much to restore the site. A school group came by and she was delighted to share her Shangra-La with them. Stay tuned for more trail improvement there this summer.</p>
      <p><strong>Vandalism </strong></p>
      <p>Lastly and sadly we are all to often <strong>&lsquo;busy&rsquo;</strong> chasing the vandal. We do build things to &lsquo;prison standards&rsquo; but the vandal has way more time on their hands than we do. We responded to nearly 2500 incidents of tagging in 2011. We don&rsquo;t call it graffiti, its vandalism with paint. We also repair many other buildings and structures. I have to share a photo of one of the most creative we&rsquo;ve seen in a while.</p>
      <p>We received a call about the modified &lsquo;jeep&rsquo; playground toy in one of our parks. As I say, they have way more time to think this stuff up.</p>

      <h2>April 27, 2012<br>
Happy Earth Week!  </h2>
<p>Spring is always a busy time for us. Spring start up, outdoor projects and celebrations abound.</p>
<p>Our Pulling Together program continues to grow and the work they are accomplishing is amazing. We have 40 park locations, 450 active volunteers and  they remove over 50 tonnes of invasive species annually. With both Volunteer Week and Earth Week just recently celebrated we&rsquo;d like to thank all those folks and recognize their &lsquo;blood, sweat and tears&rsquo;.</p>
      <p>We have also begun Phase 2 of the Mt View Park project with the narrowing of the Homer Road Right of Way. This will add to the park and be part of the trail connections in the &lsquo;campus of care&rsquo; site. New interpretive signs are being installed this spring in Browning, Doris Page, McMorran and Gorge Parks.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for public open houses for Cadboro Gyro and Cuthbert Holmes Park this spring. We will also begin planning for Panama Flats public meetings in the fall. </p>

      <h2>March  2012<br>
      Signs of Spring</h2>
<p>I am sure we are all enjoying the longer days, the sunshine &amp; the signs of spring all around us.</p>
      <p>On some recent outing in our parks, I have seen ducks pairing up, the grass growing, the buds bursting &amp; even the humming birds back.</p>
      <p>Our crews have started the spring clean up efforts. Imagine if you have 168 yards to look after. Well thats how many parks we have  now. Over 800 ha of land.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the equivalent of over 4,200 average residential lots. On top of this we have about 650 traffic islands &amp; 50 high profile streetscape areas we maintain. It&rsquo;s also the time of year our trails (100km), our playgrounds (56) and the tennis courts (36) gets busier.</p>
      <p>This isn&rsquo;t really to brag nor to complain; rather it&rsquo;s to define the scope of our operations &amp; inform that it all takes time for us to get to. Spring clean up usually takes 3-4 weeks for the crews to make the first rounds of the season. This time of year the grass grows very fast so its hard to keep up with it. </p>
      <p>In the meantime, get out &amp; enjoy the parks. If you are wondering about a service, check our web site. &nbsp;We have tried to list some of our more frequent questions or just call us &amp; we can respond to the question or service request.</p>
      <p>I&rsquo;d love to hear about what springs means to you &amp; the signs that you see or look for.</p>

      <h2>February 2012<br>
The Survey Says!</h2>
<p>Early results of the 2012 Citizens Survey were presented at the February 28th Council budget meeting. We have always known that parks are important to our community. The results of the survey reinforce this long held opinion.</p>
      <p>The results indicate that Parks &amp; Trails are ranked 4th in importance but we are exceptionally pleased that we now rank #1 for quality of service. This is the first time we have achieved this number. When asked about spending tax dollars on capital priorities Parks &amp; Trails ranked #2, a close second to Roads. So thank you for your support &amp; we will continue to work hard to provide you with the quality of service you have come to appreciate.</p>
      <p>Council also reviewed the Parks &amp; Recreation Department budget the same evening. Follow the link to see a copy of the Parks Division Fact Sheet.&nbsp; It provides a nice summary of our operation. <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/services/budget/pdf/2012-facts-parks.pdf">http://www.saanich.ca/services/budget/pdf/2012-facts-parks.pdf</a></p>

      <h2>January 2012<br>
      Happy New Year!</h2>
<p><img src="../../../images/clip_image002_007.jpg" class="float-left" alt="">We did it a new year; we made it through the holidays. We survived the food, the drink, the socializing with friends and family. Now it&rsquo;s back to everyday realities. </p>
      <p>New Years Day, like it seemed many others, was spent in Mount Douglas Park. It was such a beautiful day and of course all those resolutions to walk more, get fit etc. The parking lot was over flowing. The trails were filled with many happy smiling faces greeting us a Happy New Year. My wife and I choose to take the Whittaker Trail that loops the entire park. It was a terrific hike. We took the fork in the trail going up Little Mt Doug to get a great view of the valley. As proof, I took the attached self photo of us.&nbsp; I am sure my wife will be pleased I posted this. As always though, she looks way better than me. The hike took us just under an hour and we really enjoyed it.</p>
      <p>Saanich Parks is planning some trail improvements in the park this year. We will complete the work on the Norn Trail that we started last year. Come summer our focus will be on portions of the Whittaker Trail. We looking into the expansion of the way finding signs we have been piloting on the Irvine Trail. We are also looking at the use of technology in signs and QR codes. We may even explore some other &lsquo;low tech&rsquo; ideas too.</p>
      <p>So here&rsquo;s to 2012 and all that it will bring. Someone in our office said &lsquo;it will be better; every year is better&rsquo;. I thought this was an interesting thought. So with that in mind that is my resolution &lsquo;Be better&rsquo;. </p>

      <h2>December, 2011<br>
      'TIS THE SEASON&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Like most everyone else, I find myself saying &lsquo;where did the year go&rsquo;? Last time I wrote for this feature was summer now we are less than 2 weeks until Christmas. I&rsquo;d like to believe it&rsquo;s that I have been too busy but it really is just about making the time. Saanich Parks has been busy  and I&rsquo;d like to celebrate some of the things we have done this year.</p>
      <p>When we started the year we had identified a number of initiatives including:<strong> </strong></p>
      
      <p><strong>Concept Plans</strong> - Mt View Carey Park plans was completed and the park opened in late Nov. It will take some time for the grass to catch but the playground is open &amp; being enjoyed by the community.&nbsp; We also have made great progress on the Cuthbert Holmes &amp; Cadboro-Gyro parks. </p>
      <p><strong>Natural Area Management</strong> - We have completed Natural Area Guidelines. We are nearing completion of the Invasive Species Strategy.</p>
      <p><strong>Urban Forestry </strong>- The major initiative was canopy cover analysis which is nearing completion.</p>
      <p><strong>RInC</strong> &ndash; We completed 21 various park/playground projects.</p>
      <p><strong>Park Signage</strong> &ndash; We have reviewed park signage with an emphasis on Interpretive &amp; Way Finding. Install new signs. We have 27 interpretive sign in our current inventory. We also have over 20 maps or directional signs. We have installed new signs this year in Mt Douglas Park (Salmon Life Cycle &amp; Trail Markers), Baxter Park (ecosystems), Knockan Hill Park (information) &amp; Prospect Lake (lake access info). We also have 9 other sign projects nearing completion.</p>
      <p><strong>Mt Douglas &ndash;</strong> We completed creek work, in partnership with the Friends of Mt Douglas during the summer. We also have a creek/weir study underway that will help guide future work in the creek &amp; the watershed. We have completed the environmental assessments to support the parking area &amp; trail access off 4439 Blenkinsop Rd. This will provide safer &amp; better trailhead access to the park from the west side of the park.</p>
      <p><strong>Park Development &ndash;</strong> This fall we completed park development of Harvest Lane &amp; Fairburn.</p>
      <p><strong>Parks &amp; Recreation Master Plan &ndash;</strong> Over the past year the Department has been seeking community input on the futre direction for the Department. The opportunity to provide final comment is open until Jan 8, 2012. Follow the link: <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/parkrec/masterplan.html">http://www.saanich.ca/parkrec/masterplan.html</a>. </p>
      <p>A few other highlights include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Feltham</strong><strong> Park</strong> &ndash; Adjacent private development helped fund the regarding of the trail &amp; invasive specie removal. Volunteers have helped with our restoration program.</li>
        <li><strong>Mt Tolmie</strong> &ndash; In partnership with Saanich Rotary &amp; the Mt Tolmie Community Association we unveiled a new geographic marker on the summit.</li>
        <li><strong>Browning</strong><strong> Park</strong> &ndash; In June with the help of the Camosun Community Association we opened the park. We also named the frog Bowker Browning as our mascot.</li>
        <li><strong>Championships </strong>&ndash; Hampton Park &amp; Lambrick Park were hosts for Little League Provincials &amp; Western Canadian Midget AAA Baseball respectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Rolston Trail Pilot Project</strong> - In partnership with the Broadmead Area Residents&rsquo; Association (BARA), Saanich Parks is launching a pilot project on the Rolston Trail that will designate the trail as pedestrian only. This is effective immediately upon installation of appropriate signage and will run until the end of June 2012. We are looking for comments so please email us at <a href="mailto:parks@saanich.ca">parks@saanich.ca</a> . </li>
        <li><strong>Tree Appreciation Day</strong> - Was celebrated on November 6, 2011 in Bow/Feltham and Mount Douglas Park. Over 3200 native trees and shrubs were planted by over 130 volunteers in three hours. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>2012</strong> will be another busy year and some of the more notable projects will include:</p>
      <p><strong>Concept Plans &ndash; </strong>completing Cuthbert Holmes and Cadboro-Gyro but also starting on the recent acquisitions of Panama Flats &amp; Haro.</p>
      <p><strong>Urban Forestry &ndash;</strong> continued implementation of the Strategy including tree planting plans &amp; bylaw review</p>

      <h2>July 28, 2011<br>
SUMMER FUN  </h2>
<p>It took until mid-July but we finally got a taste of summer. I hope you have all had a chance to get out &amp; enjoy it.</p>
      <p>I recently took a great bike ride around using our Saanich trails. I want to share the route &amp; few highlights along the way. We live in the Marigold area so we started at Hyacinth Park. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We travelled along the Colquitz River Trail into Panama Flats. The birders were active as we observed a few taking time to photograph some of the water fowl. </li>
        <li>We followed the trail through Copley Park past our recently upgraded playgrounds &amp; eventually across Mann up the hill into Brydon Park. Brydon Park, the tennis courts &amp; trails were being well used. </li>
        <li>Then we used the Royal Oak underpass to get across to Broadmead. There we followed the marked on-street route along Royal Oak Ave to Carolwood to Emily Carr &amp; up to Royal Oak Drive getting us to the Lochside Regional Trail. So we only had a short time on the busy Drive in the bike lane. </li>
        <li>Along the way we stopped to look at Roy &amp; the Centennial Rings, both are public art installations that we are proud of. Pushing on we went past Saanich Municipal Hall and the Switch Bridge.&nbsp; </li>
        <li>Then along the Galloping Goose Regional Trail, just past the bridge over Interurban we hopped onto Burnside Road near the Pacific Forestry Centre, across McKenzie &amp; home was only a block or so away.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All told we were out for about an hour. We observed that within the first few minutes on the Lochside we&rsquo;d already encountered the same number of people we&rsquo;d seen on the entire first half of the loop. The riding is just as easy, there is plenty to see &amp; actually more parkland to explore on this part of the loop.</p>
      <p><a href="../../../images/RaesBlogMap.jpg">Click here </a>to view the map that outlines the route. Get out &amp; try it. Or share with me your favorite route.</p>
      <p>I also just returned from a visit to Beckwith Park. Summer fun was in full swing. Tennis Courts in use as a coach was preparing some youth lads for a tennis event. The playground was full &amp; the Frog Pond was teeming with children. The parents were all sitting back soaking the sun &amp; their children&rsquo;s delight. There were also at least three day camps there, two were Saanich Parks &amp; Recreation programs plus one from a neighbouring community. What a hub of summer fun.</p>
      <p>So I hope you are all getting some summer fun in. Our parks system has lots to offer. Share some of your summer fun; we&rsquo;d love to hear about it.</p>

      <h2>June 27, 2011<br>
Best of Saanich Parks</h2>
<p>Recently the News Group published their annual Best of the City awards. As we enter the second week of summer (yes it did arrive on June 21) I thought I&rsquo;d produce my own &lsquo;best of&rsquo; list. But these are the Best of Saanich Parks.</p>
      <p><strong>Best Views</strong> &ndash; Many of our parks offer great vistas &amp; views of the City/Region, the San Juan Islands or the Olympic Peninsula. We all know Mt Douglas &amp; Mt Tolmie but try Peacock Hill, Knockan Hill or Sayward Hill for a change.</p>
      <p><strong>Beach Beaches </strong>&ndash; For a family time you can&rsquo;t beat Cadboro-Gyro Park. If you are into skim board Arbutus Cove is the place. But Mt Douglas Park &amp; Cordova Bay offer great summer time beach fun too.</p>
      <p><strong>Secret getaway &ndash; </strong>Outerbridge Park was created out of the vision of Mrs. Outerbridge&rsquo; Shangri-la. We have partnered with her &amp; the Glendale gardens &amp; it&rsquo;s a hidden gem worth the visit. A small parking lot is accessible off of Royal Oak Dr. near Lochside School</p>
      <p><strong>Best Trails &ndash; </strong>With nearly 100kms of trails in Saanich it&rsquo;s hard to say what&rsquo;s best. Best depends on what you want to do or where you live. One of the best trails is always the closest one for me. But a great summer adventures is to get on the Interurban Rail Trail &amp; ride out to the Red Barn. When you get there have a cold drink, coffee or ice cream &amp; then come back to town. It&rsquo;s a great ride through rural Saanich.</p>
      <p><strong>Best Playgrounds &ndash; </strong>We have 54 to choose from with 2 new ones coming this summer at Harvest Lane &amp; Mt View Parks. But with the Federal Recreational Infrastructure Canada grant we updated 10 playgrounds last year. Try out Browning, Copley, Glanford or Layritz to name a few.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Best Frog Pond &ndash; </strong>The water park at Beckwith Park is called the Frog Pond. It&rsquo;s open daily July 1 to Labour Day 10 am &ndash; 6 pm; June &amp; Sept noon &ndash; 4pm daily.</p>
      <p><strong>Largest Heron Colony &ndash; </strong>Cuthbert Holmes Park<strong> </strong>supports the largest breeding colony on Vancouver Island for the Great Blue Heron. There were 66 nest recorded in 2010. The Great Blue Heron is a protected species provincially. Therefore, care must be taken in the development &amp; maintenance of the Park. But they are a sight to see &amp; make for a highlight of your visit to the park.</p>

Partnerships      </h2>
      <p><strong><em><img src="../../../images/GeographicMarker.JPG" class="float-left" alt=""></em></strong><strong><em>Working in partnership with our community, our mission is to create a quality of life that supports healthy lifestyles and preserves and protects our natural environment.</em></strong></p>
      <p>When this Mission statement was developed the cornerstone is based on PARTNERSHIPS. Over the past few weeks I have been witnessed some of the recent successes based on this mission.</p>
      <p>On May 11 we gathered at the summit of Mt Tolmie to unveil a geographic marker. This marker was a partnership with the Mt Tolmie Community Association, Saanich Rotary &amp; Saanich Parks. It is also the final piece of the Phase 1 Summit improvements that we undertook with help from a Provincial Tourism Grant.&nbsp; For many years Mt Tolmie won the News Groups Best View of the City. Thanks to our partners this marker makes one more reason to visit. Until you can get there in person, check out the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/ANewsVanIsland#p/u/21/XsT6dMc2eO0">A Channel news story</a>.</p>
      
      <p><img src="../../../images/MtViewCarey-Large.jpg" class="float-right" alt="" width="378" height="150">Last night, May 16 Council adopted the concept plan &amp; name for the new Mount View Park. This culminates over 2 years of community consultation &amp; partnerships with the Mt View Carey Colquitz Community Association (MVCCA) along with the CRD &amp; Mourgard. We were pleased to work with the MVCCA through the planning of this park. We now look forward to the partnership evolving as we enter the construction &amp; ultimately the operational phases. We share in their excitement &amp; look forward to the sod turning in late June. A copy of the approved concept plan is available by <a href="../projects/current/mtcarey.html">clicking here</a>. </p>
      <p>This is only 2 examples of <strong><em>&lsquo;working in partnership&rsquo;</em></strong>. We have many more; from the day to day relationships with all our Sports Groups, Community Associations &amp; Friends of Groups to special capital improvement projects; we are proud of them all. </p>
      <p>Later this year watch for other partnered projects such as: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>playground improvements in Marigold Park, </li>
        <li>new park development at Harvest Lane &amp; Fairburn Parks,</li>
        <li>new interpretive signage at Baxter Pond &amp; Mt Douglas Park</li>
        <li>Pulling Together invasive species projects</li>
        <li>new Blenkinsop parking lot &amp; trail head for Mt Douglas</li>

      <h2>April 28, 2011<br>
      Share the Trail Saanich</h2>
<p>Over the Easter Weekend I got out with family &amp; friends to enjoy some of our fantastic parks &amp; trails. I was not alone. With the sun finally shining the trails were full of people making great use of the over 95 km of trails we have in Saanich. </p>
      <p>Trails in Saanich serve many needs and must respond to a wide range of conditions. We have guidelines for their development &amp; maintenance. We also have developed the Share the Trail Saanich program to encourage safe enjoyable use by all.</p>
      
      <p>The <strong>Goal</strong> of our system is:</p>
      <p><strong>To provide a network of interconnected trails that offers a range of opportunities for recreational activities, transportation, and is respectful to the environment. </strong></p>
      <p>Trails are seen to contribute to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>recreational infrastructure</li>
        <li>regional and local transportation network</li>
        <li>environmental network</li>
        <li>Personal health and fitness. </li>
        <li>economic community of Saanich</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Saanich will be guided by these <strong>principles</strong> when developing and upgrading trails:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Inclusiveness</strong>. </li>
        <li><strong>Environmental protection </strong></li>
        <li><strong>Safety </strong>.<strong></strong></li>
        <li><strong>Enjoyment </strong></li>
        <li><strong>Connectivity </strong></li>
        <li><strong>Community involvement</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Fiscal responsibility</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Share the Trail Saanich</strong></p>
      <p>A few simple, common-sense considerations will make your trail-travel safer and more enjoyable for everyone: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Share the trail</strong>. Show consideration for others. </li>
        <li><strong>Please keep to the right</strong> except when passing. </li>
        <li><strong>Control your speed</strong>, yield to slower moving trail users. </li>
        <li><strong>Warn others</strong> when passing. </li>
        <li><strong>Control and clean up</strong> after your pets. </li>
        <li><strong>Respect the environment and neighbours</strong>, keep to the trail. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Look for us spreading the work with our partners.&nbsp; Saanich Police will help us in the upcoming School Bike Rodeos. We will also be back at the Celebration Station at Saanich Hall along the Lochside Trail during Bike to Work Week May 30 &ndash; June 5</p>
      <p>I hope you have found this information valuable &amp; please get out &amp; enjoy our trails but remember to <strong>Share the Trail Saanich</strong>.</p>

      <h2>April 12, 2011<br>
      Who Cares?</h2>
<p>In 1978 I switched my University program into Parks &amp; Recreation. I took a first year class called Foundations in Recreation from Dr. Howard Nixon. Howie had a profound influence on me &amp; I like to tell people the one thing I learned in university was from Howie. I now realize he taught me more than one thing and so did a few other key professors, bosses, Mayors and citizens along the way. But lately that so called 1 thing Howie taught me has been haunting me.</p>
      <p>One day, all us young bright but maybe a bit blurry eyed or na&iuml;ve student we asked to tell Howie what he&rsquo;d drawn on the chalk board. It was a half moon divided into 3 pieces. 2 small pieces one marked + the other marked &ndash; sign. The big piece in the middle had the letters WC&rsquo;s. After a few minutes of letting us flounder; he put us out of our misery. He announced &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the public on any given issue&rsquo;.</p>
      <p class="align-centre"><img src="../../../images/clip_image002_003.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p>He explained that on any issue 10% will love it; you&rsquo;d be lucky to hear from them. 10% will hate it; they will make themselves heard. The rest, 80% Who Cares. But they, Howie explained are the Who we need to hear from &amp; why we do what we do. Remember this was 1978.</p>
      <p>In the 1979 Federal Election the voter turnout was 76%. It had been that way from 1867 until 1980 when it dipped below the 70% mark. In 2008 it was 59%. In 2008, municipal elections Vancouver had 31% while here in Saanich we had only 20% voter turnout..</p>
      <p>On March 2, we hosted a public open house on the future of Cadboro-Gyro Park. It is a&nbsp; 6 Ha waterfront park. It is one of our only true waterfront parks for the whole of Saanich&rsquo;s 110,000+ residents. One would argue its may also be regional in nature. We advertised in the Saanich News, sent out 310 letters to the immediate neighbourhood yet only&nbsp; 95 turned out for the meeting. To-date we have received 62 comments on the plan.</p>
      <p>Last week, April 4-7, each evening we hosted open houses to discuss the Saanich Parks &amp; Recreation Master Plan. Over the 4 nights we had 54 people in total. The best turn out was the Tuesday night at Gordon Head Rec Centre with 16. We received 21 comments sheets to-date. This meeting was well advertised &amp; promoted in a variety of ways.</p>
      <p>Is it apathy, indifference or disenchantment with government? Is it that we are all too busy? We see issues becoming more &amp; more polarized. The media is full of negativity. So 30 years later, Howie&rsquo;s words are still true. Who Cares? </p>
      <p>But we know you do! Saanich is a proud community. Civic minded. We have active Community Associations, many sports groups.&nbsp; Plus we know you love your parks. </p>
      <p>We care too. Our challenge is to find a way to get your feedback. We still use public meetings and open houses. We do letters to neighbours. We use the Web &amp; are now experimenting with social media to link into people.</p>
      <p>But back to Howie. I have lost touch with him but I think of him occasionally. He set a foundation in parks &amp; recreation that has followed me from the dry land prairies to the wet coast. </p>
      <p>So please let your voice be heard. Particularly if you like what we are doing. Don&rsquo;t assume we know or that others will tell us. We need to hear it. But if you don&rsquo;t like what we are doing or something have done or not done. If you have a question or concern we want to hear about that too.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, feels a bit more like spring get out &amp; enjoy our parks!</p>

      <h2>Feb 25, 2011</h2>
      <p>Who ever said time is continuous. We all know about time flying or coming to a stand still. In my case; where did the time go? Last time I posted it was Movember now it&rsquo;s almost March.</p>
      <p>Just as we were ready to enjoy some of the early spring flowers THE SNOW COMES. It has been a long winter although it could be worse. The rest of &lsquo;winter&rsquo; Canada has been experiencing a tough winter too. </p>
      <p>As I grew up in a traditional prairie winter climate by best advice is; enjoy it. Build a snow man, make snow angels, take a walk in the snow. Better yet dig out those X-C Skis &amp; go for it.</p>
      <p>Once the snow melts, spring will be around the corner. We will have a shorter than normal turn around for spring clean up &amp; before we know it ball season will be here.</p>
      <p>We also have a number of projects planned this year. Stay tuned for information about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cadboro-Gyro Park Plan &ndash; March 2 open house</li>
        <li>Cuthbert Holmes Concept Plan &ndash; open house in next month or so</li>
        <li>Neighbourhood Park projects - Marigold playground, Harvest Lane, Fairburn, Folwer</li>
        <li>Interpretive &amp; Way finding signs</li>
        <li>Mt Douglas projects</li>

      <h2>Movember 2, 2010</h2>
      <p><strong>The Forest &amp; the Trees</strong></p>
      <p>Saanich has a new Urban Forest Strategy. Last night Council unanimously approved it. &ldquo;IT&rdquo; was 18 months in the making. But some might say it&rsquo;s been nearly 2 decades in the making. Saanich was one of the first municipalities to adopt a Tree Preservation Bylaw in 1993. Now we are taking the next step to create a sustainable, healthy community with the Urban Forest Strategy. We have engaged the community in a discussion to develop a long-term plan to achieve a sustainable urban forest. </p>
      <p>We define the Urban Forest as:</p>
      <p><strong><em>&ldquo;the sum total of all trees &amp; their related ecosystems within the municipality.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
      <p>Urban forests play an important role in contributing to the environmental integrity and climate change resiliency of Saanich. They filter air and water, create shade, provide habitat and slow wind and storm water. Urban forests contribute to the social well-being of Saanich by providing healthy and enjoyable recreation opportunities, moderating local climate, shading homes and businesses to conserve energy, and are critical in mitigating the urban heat island effect. Urban forests contribute to the economic vibrancy of Saanich through increased property values and encouraging business on tree-lined streets.</p>
      
      <p>The Saanich Urban Forest Vision is:</p>
      <p><strong>&ldquo;<em>The urban forest in Saanich is a highly valued asset comprised of a rich and diverse forest that is widely recognized and appreciated for the contribution that it makes to our community and to our sustainable environment.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
      
      <p>The goal is:</p>
      <p><strong><em>&ldquo;Protect and Enhance the Urban Forest&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
      <p>The seven Strategies are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Grow the Urban Forest Canopy,</li>
        <li>Amend the Tree Preservation Bylaw,</li>
        <li>Develop Urban Forest Guidelines,</li>
        <li>Integrate the Strategy with other Saanich &amp; Regional Initiatives,</li>
        <li>Inventory the Urban Forest,</li>
        <li>Develop an Urban Forest Operations Program, and</li>
        <li>Engage the Community.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are several actions that support each of the strategy statements &amp; over the next few years Parks staff along with other internal stakeholders will continue to work with the community to implant the vision of a rich, diverse &amp; appreciated sustainable urban forest. </p>
      <p>I want to thank the community, staff &amp; our consultants for participating in the process. This process has reminded us all that Saanich is a community that cares &amp; is passionate about their community &amp; it&rsquo;s Urban Forest.</p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s also Movember. Over 30 men in Saanich Parks are participating with the League of Municipal Gentleman from Saanich that are all growing a &lsquo;mo&rsquo; as part of the Movember for men&rsquo;s health &amp; prostate cancer awareness.</p>

      <h2>October 1, 2010 - Building Community</h2>
      <p>Without sounding like &lsquo;crying the blues&rsquo; at times we only hear about something we have done wrong. In the middle of this week we received some feedback that truly resonated with me. It reminded why we do what we do &amp; specifically why I choose a career in parks/recreation.</p>
      <p>In this blog I have written about $3M RinC program &amp; the 21 parks we are upgrading with the help of the Federal grant. The focus was on upgrading existing infrascturre &amp; in some case where we had previously approved park concept plans we have been able to expand the assets within the park.</p>
      <p>Glanford Park is an example of this. It has been home to football, soccer, horseshoe, community gardens &amp; of course neighbourhood playground. In fact, the original development pre-dated the dedication as park that first occurred in 1981. But since the late 80&rsquo;s the park has remained relatively unchanged.&nbsp; But with the RinC funding we have installed the new playground, sport court and associated trail work has been installed in accordance with the December 2009 Council approved concept plan. Minor improvements to the Agnes Street Allotment gardens have also been completed.</p>
      <p>But the reminder came in the form of an unsolicited comment from a park neighbour. Her comments are as follows:</p>
      
      <blockquote> &ldquo;I wanted to say thank you for renewing the play park at the Glanford Soccer field. I have lived near the park for four years and have never seen anyone playing there. Since the new equipment was put in there are kids there every time I drive by. AND I go there pretty much every day with my three year old and we always have someone to play with there. What a great way to build the community. I didn't know how great a neighborhood park was until I got one. Thank you again. Melanie&rdquo; </blockquote>
      
      <p>This is it. We made a difference. We have built community. We enrich people&rsquo;s lives. It is the embodiment of our mission that states:</p>
      <p><strong>We create opportunities that enrich the community, sustain quality environments and support healthy lifestyles.</strong></p>
      <p>To Melanie I say thank you for sharing your comments with us. We are pleased with the results, your satisfaction &amp; the reminder it has provided me</p>

      <p>August 24, 2010 - <strong>Summer Flies &amp; Winters Walk!</strong></p>
      <p>I recall this as the title of a Peanuts Collection by Charles Shultz. As a kid, I remember thinking it funny then as it related to summer vacation from school &amp; while it&rsquo;s been a long 30+ years since school this summer has taken flight. I know, technically we are still in summer until Sept 21 but as August comes to a close, the Back to School ads on everywhere I am left wondering where it went.</p>
      <p>Over this spring/summer, time has flown by with our crews &amp; contractors busy with the RinC park/playground program. We have completed projects at Marigold, Rudd, Lochside &amp; Braefoot parks. We are nearly completed with the resurfacing of the 8 tennis courts. &nbsp;The Lambrick Tennis Court replacement is underway &amp; should re-open later this fall. Other projects that will be finished this fall include: Browning, Falaise, Glanford, Hampton, Layritz &amp; Playfair parks. Thanks to the Federal Infrastructure Program over 20 parks are being upgraded this year.</p>
      <p>But there is still time for you or me for that matter to get out &amp; enjoy summer in our parks. This weekend I plan to head to the beach with my teenage sons for some skim boarding. It&rsquo;s all they could talk about after our annual summer trip back to the Prairies to see family. Or better yet a bike ride &amp; some badly needed exercise. Or maybe both. With 165 parks in Saanich there is so much to do.</p>

      <h2>May 2010 - When the winds blow&hellip;our phones ring</h2>
      <p>April brought some unseasonable wind events and when the winds are like they have been we suffer tree failures. Over the Easter weekend we had a major event and we received over 20 calls about partial or complete tree failures. As of noon April 27th, we had over 35. Our trained professional staff is responding and will continue for the next few days.      </p>
      <p><strong><img src="/images/WEBShelbourneWarMemorialTreePlanting2010049.jpg" class="float-right" alt="Shelbourn War Memorial Tree Planting" width="314" height="235" />When it&rsquo;s not blowing we can occasionally plant a few trees</strong></p>
      <p>Last year was a record year for tree planting but none more significant that the 3 London Plane trees that were replaced on Shelbourne last week on Earth Day. 30 Grade 7 students of Mr. Alex de Medeiros Gordon Head Middle School took quite an interest in the significance of these trees and noticed that 3 were missing. They work with staff from Saanich Parks and Engineering and we are pleased to have helped replace the missing trees. The trees were originally planted at end of WW1 to honor the fallen BC/Victoria soldiers. The students also wanted to bring the honor forward to the present and we recognized Bombardier Mansell and Lieutenant Nuttall who lost their lives serving in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p><strong>Parks are places for Public Art</strong></p>
      <p><img src="../../../images/GorgeArt.JPG" alt="Camossung by Fred Dobbs" width="235" height="314" class="float-left" />I also had the opportunity to attend the public unveiling of the new Public Art installation in Gorge Waterway Park. Saturday April 24, Camossung by Fred Dobbs is tremendous contribution to the park. It tells an ancient Songhees story of a young girl of a young girl turned to stone and is believed to have spirit powers to help protect local food sources. The piece is within sight and only a few meters of the original sacred stone located below the Tillicum Bridge. </p>
      <p>If you are interested we have other public art installations along the Lochside Trail (Centennial Rings &amp; Roy) and in Rutledge Park the Stone Poems. We also partnered with Colquitz Middle School and the Garth Homer Society as part of River Song to install and raise awareness of the Colquitz Creek as part of BC Rivers Day.</p>
      <p>So more &amp; more reasons to enjoy our parks (when the wind isn&rsquo;t blowing)</p>

      <h2 class="float-clear">April 2010 - Spring has arrived&hellip;.</h2>
      <p>It sure feels like it. Flowers are out, trees are not only leafing out but blossoms have formed, the grass is growing &amp; the phone is ringing.</p>
      <p>But who expected a November type wind storm in April. We received over 100 tree related calls &amp; our crews have been out to all the highest priority calls. The remainder we are working on it as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>The maintenance crews have completed the first cutting of all our parks &amp; boulevards. Baseball is in full swing.</p>
      <p>Next month the new Pesticide Bylaw comes into affect. Many alternatives to control weeds exist &amp; we will in fact just need to be more tolerate of them. There is some good information about what we do on our site as well as at <a href="http://pesticide.saanich.ca">www.pesticide.saanich.ca</a></p>
      <p>Take care &amp; get out &amp; enjoy a new park or trail soon.</p>

      <h2>March 2010 - The Canada We Once Were</h2>
      <p>My last entry was about the excitement and pride I was feeling about the Games. I wrote about the value of sport and recreation in our society. Now that the games are over, my feelings have not changed. </p>
      <p>The opening ceremonies and the poem by Shane Koyczan, <em>We Are More</em>, captures many feelings we have about who we are but have never put into words. In John Forlong&rsquo;s speech during the closing ceremonies he states &lsquo;the Canada that was with the Canada that now is. I believe we Canadians tonight are stronger, more united, more in love with our country and more connected with each other than ever before&rsquo;. Never before have we seen so my pride in the True North Strong and Free.</p>
      <p>I was lucky enough to travel over to take in the middle weekend of the Games. I got to see first hand the spirit. We watch live with 22,000 others in BC Place as Jon Montgomery received his Gold Medal. As we all sang &lsquo;Oh Canada&rsquo; loud and proud. W watched the hockey game on the ferry and shared in the disappointment in our loss to the USA. But later we were standing along with many others to clap for our amazing Ice Dancers. Of course both went on to win Gold. These are wonderful memories to share with my family for years to come.</p>
      <p>A lot has been said about &ldquo;Owning the Podium&rsquo;. It is an expression, a mantra to focus on excellence to achieve. Let&rsquo;s stay the course. So the Canada we once were. We now do <strong>BELIEVE</strong>!</p>
      <p>Oh yeah, this is supposed to be about Parks. Maybe next time, I am still on an Olympic high, bring on the Paralympic Games.</p>

      <h2>February 2010 - Let The Games Begin</h2>
      <p>I must admit, I have a fever. The only cure is to tune into the Olympics.</p>
      <p> I remember the gathering to watch the bid announcement, I read lots of articles, I've heard
        all the criticism, I saw the torch go by the park offices, I have friends who are volunteers
        & we are going over next weekend but today as I write this, opening day, I am really excited.                      
	  <p> Politics & sport have gone hand in hand since the beginning of time and from the origins of
					    the Olympic movement. I recall at University in an introductory recreation class learning
					    about & debating the issue. But let's face it. National pride & community pride does come out
					    of our sports. Ask any one born in Saskatchewan (like me) about football & they will start
					    singing 'Green is the color'. Edmonton is the City of Champions. But we also see politics &
					    sport mixing in local community sport. </p>
                      <p> As I am writing this CBC is reporting on protestors blocking the torch run. I also saw on TV
                        this morning the young Victoria student from St Andrews whose run in Victoria on day 1 of the
                        relay got another chance on the Sea Wall today. Good for her. I have heard lots of complaints
                        about the cost & expense of security. I was in Medicine Hat AB in 1988 when the Calgary
                        Olympics were held. I recall the torch run. I looked down the street, saw the torch, it
                        stopped at City Hall & then it went. In 2010, I saw cops cars, security details, sponsors then
                        finally the torch then more cops & security. Apparently warranted as later that day marbles
                        are thrown into the road & ultimately interrupted & rerouted stealing their Olympic Spirit &
                        moment. </p>
                      <p> Does the cost of Olympics bother me; yes. Do we have social issues that need attention; yes.
                        But sport does build community; yes. Now Rugby 7's is now an Olympic sport & many young
                        Canadians (including my son) now have an Olympic Dream to complete for their Country. As a
                        professional parks & recreation administrator our movement believes that healthy communities
                        benefit from recreation & sport. </p>
                      <p> I say GO CANDA GO! Put it behind us & let the games begin peacefully & may the best rise to
                        the top! </p>

                      <h2>January 2010</h2>
                      <p>Happy New Year & Spring is Near!</p>
                      <p> As everyone returns to work & the regular retinue after the holidays we at Saanich Parks are
                        already seeing the signs of spring. </p>
                      <p> Our terrific administrative support team are getting all sorts of spring like calls & parks
                        bookings. Every year more & more residents want to book their favourite family event, school
                        function or wedding in one of our parks. </p>
                      <p> As people also get out into the parks & trails we are getting reports of items that need our
                        attention. Our staff does a great job of anticipating needs but we always appreciate a call if
                        you think we need to know about something. The contact info at the bottom is a quick & easy
                        way to report a problem. </p>
                      <p> But the sure sign of spring is our vegetation. The tree buds are swelling & we even have some
                        early daffodils up. I saw them this week at the Quadra/Chatterton intersection. Our
                        Horticulture staff tells me these are called February Gold but they are a month early, We
                        won't complain, we'll take this January Gold anytime. </p>

                      <h2>December 2009</h2>
                      <p> <img src="/images/parksrec/parks/christmas_card09.jpg" class="float-right" alt="">Happy Holidays! 'tis the season they say. </p>
                      <p> Over the past year our Saanich Parks elves have been busy maintaining our over 165 parks &
                        750 Ha of park land. They cut the grass, pick up the litter, line the sport fields, tend the
                        trails, maintain the urban forest, beautify the community & of course are stewards to the
                        environment. </p>
                      <p> Most of this work is recognized & I am always amazed at how appreciative our community is for
                        the work we do. But believe me, I have had the pleasure of working in 3 provinces & in 5
                        different municipalities & without a doubt Saanich folks are the most thankful. </p>
                      <p>However, some of the more 'unglamorous' does go unnoticed. These activities include:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Boulevard &amp; roadside mowing</li>

                      </ul>
                      <p>Some of our notable successes this year include:</p>

                      <h2>November 2009</h2>
                      <p>Ch Ch Changes</p>
                      <p> David Bowie wrote about Ch Ch Change in 1971, Bob Dylan had already written about 'the times
                        they are a- changin' back in 1964, Blind melon wrote Change in 1992. I am sure if I was to
                        research artist, philosophers alike have written, talked or thought about CHANGE. In Saanich
                        Parks, we are talking and living change. </p>
                      <p> Over the past few months Saanich has had 3 significant members of our management team retire.
                        The first was our Planner extraordinaire, Russ Fuoco at the end of September. Saanich Parks
                        will miss Russ as he was a tremendous support of parks and guided us through change with our
                        role in the development process. However, we look forward to a continued great relationship
                        with his successor, Sharon Hvodanski. Next in October, our own Ken Kreiger, Director of Parks
                        & Recreation retired after 19 years with Saanich Parks & Recreation. Ken is tremendously well
                        respected professional and a great believer in community development and partnerships. </p>
                      <p> Then before Ken's successor could even be named; Gerald Fleming, Parks Planning & Design
                        Manager retired on Nov 25/09 after nearly 23 years with Saanich Parks. Gerald arrived in 1987
                        and at that time we had less than 90 parks. Over the next 23 years Gerald has had a hand in
                        the development of nearly 80% of the current park system. We are now over 165 parks & 750 Ha
                        of land. Under his guidance many new parks or existing parks were constructed or redeveloped.
                        The list includes: McMinn, Beckwith, Brydon, Sierra, Rutledge and Gorge Waterway. He was also
                        very involved in Natural Park/environmental projects such as Quick's Bottom, Glencoe
                        Cove-Kwatsech, & Rithet's Bog. He also over saw Sport Park and facility improvements with
                        soccer fields, the skate park & the redevelopment of the 2 lacrosse boxes. He was also
                        instrumental in the development of the Galloping Goose, Lochside Trails, the Blenkinsop
                        Trestle and Centennial Trails. His contribution to the positive change in our community is
                        evident through the park system. The sharing of stories and the genuine appreciation from many
                        of our park "Friends of" and Community Associations is a tribute to the respect he has from
                        the community, staff and industry professionals. </p>
                      <p> So we are in the middle of change with staff as well as social, economic and environmental
                        considerations we face as we approach 2010. Our park infrastructure will be changing thanks to Federal
                        funding though the Recreation Infrastructure Canada program. The focus of the program will be on our
                        Playgrounds, Sport Courts, Sports fields & Tennis Courts. Council will be soon considering a Bylaw to
                        Regulate the Non-Essential Use of Pesticides along with a revision to the Council Policy on Integrated
                        Pesticide Management. All the while we have continued to completed improvements along the Colquitz
                        River, Mt. Douglas and Mt. Tolmie Parks as well as the Lake Hill Lawn Bowling Clubhouse project has
                        begun. </p>
                      <p> So CHANGE is all around us, it's always easier when you initiate it but it's inevitable as the
                        song says 'you got to change'. I am pleased for Russ, Ken and Gerald and miss them all
                        greatly. However, I am excited about the future very much looking forward to working with our
                        talented team of park staff to keep meeting the changing needs of our community. </p>
                      <h2>October 2009</h2>
                      <p> Where has the time gone? Its been too long since I have Raeved about our parks. Over the
                        summer I did the 'Chevy Chase' vacation, we drove over 6800 km taking in Western Canada back
                        to Saskatchewan, then south through Montana, Idaho, Utah,  Nevada & California. Then home
                        through Oregon & Washington. We saw lots of countryside, communities & of course parks along
                        the way. It was a great but even better to be home. Returning I am proud to boast about our
                        parks & the work our staff do day in day out. </p>
                      <p> <img src="/images/parksrec/parks/river_song_mosaic.jpg" class="float-left" alt=""> Recently BC Rivers Day was celebrated & we were pleased to support RiverSong. The event will
                        included a celebration of pebble mosaics created by the students of Colquitz Middle School. It
                        also marks the reopening of the boardwalk. This section features a new curved concrete
                        platform with wood handrails.  Parks have worked closely with Public Works and Environmental
                        Services in building this structure in a sensitive riparian area that was completed as part of
                        our capital program this year. </p>
                      <p> We have also been working on the lower Churchill Drive Parking Lot in Mount Douglas Park. Once
                        complete, the lot will be better organized for parking and pedestrian use, while reducing
                        encroachment and dumping into the natural areas of the park. </p>
                      <p> In Browning Park two bridges are scheduled for replacement and a multi-use trail will be built
                        connecting Knight Street to Wordsworth through Browning Park. This project is supported
                        through a LocalMotion grant, and is a step toward the vision of the Bowker Creek Greenway. </p>
                      <p>Its so good to be HOME!</p>

                      <p> It's a great time to get out & enjoy one of our many waterfront parks, beaches or beach
                        accesses. </p>
                      <p> In a recent article in the TC Jack Knox lists some of the well known favourites & of course
                        some of the hidden gems. </p>
                      <p> The Frog Park (Beckwith Water Park) is also now open daily from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. It's
                        another great place to enjoy some family fun & keep cool. </p>
                      <p> I also want to thank the Gorge Tillicum Community Association for having us as part of their
                        10th Annual Canada Celebration. We participated in the Parade & our staff we on hand answering
                        questions & meeting many happy people. It is always rewarding to get such great positive
                        feedback as well as many great suggestions on things people would like to see. </p>

                      <h2>June 1, 2009</h2>
                      <p>Feels like summer. June is here.</p>
                      <p> Baseball season is in full swing. Trail and beach use is up. We have over 44 beach accesses
                        that call on days like these. But the best sign of summer is June 1 when the water gets turned
                        on at the Beckwith Frog Pond water park. The waterpark operates noon - 4:00 pm daily in
                        June/September and 10:00 am - 6:00 pm July - August. </p>
                      <p> Another sign of summer is park bookings. Over the next month Cadboro-Gyro Park, Mount Douglas
                        and Beckwith are popular destinations for dozens of schools and thousands of students who use
                        our parks for year end celebration. </p>
                      <p> On Saturday May 30, I attended the release of 50,000 Chum Salmon Fry into Douglas Creek on
                        Saturday. Bob Bridgeman, Streamkeeper with the Friends of Mount Douglas (FOMD) has been
                        working to restore salmon to the creek for the past 10 years. Recently, an oil spill into the
                        watershed delayed the planned release. And now, 24 hours after the chum fry release we have
                        experienced another. This is very frustrating for all involved. We all have a role to play in
                        protecting our watersheds. We are working on watershed planning for Douglas Creek and it now
                        seems a broader approach with more education may also be required. We will be working with
                        Saanich Engineering to follow up on the immediate concerns and the rest of these other efforts
                        will take time and resources. </p>
                      <p> The Rhododendrons are peaking in Playfair Park. The late spring seems to have brought them all
                        to bloom at once. Get out  to see them while the show is still on. </p>
                      <p> Garlic Mustard is the latest invasive plant that is challenging us. We are working with many
                        to launch an early Detection Rapid Response. Follow the link below to find out more on this <a href="/living/natural/stewardship/invasive.html">new invader</a>. </p>

                      <h2>April 22, 2009</h2>
                      <p>Happy Earth Day!</p>
                      <p> What better day to rave about Saanich Parks than the annual Earth Day. The annual celebration
                        is 39 years old this year. It was intended to bring attention to environmental degradation by
                        staging an environmental teach-in. Today it is celebrated in over 170 countries in the world. </p>
                      <p> Today we are planting trees in Gordon Head, we are supporting some stewardship activities at
                        Glendale Gardens and this weekend more community stewardship activities will take place in
                        Cuthbert Holmes Park in conjunction with the Gorge-Tillicum Community Association. </p>
                      <p> Everyday, we work to preserve, protect and enhance the over 700 Ha of parkland in Saanich. In
                        addition, we look after boulevards and administer the Tree Preservation Bylaw. We have also
                        been working hard to find ways to re-green Saanich Parks. Over the past few years efforts have
                        been made to preserve/protect the environment by making changes in the following areas:
                        Irrigation, Fertilizer, Integrated Pest Management (IPM), Buildings, Parks Maintenance,
                        Natural Area Mgt, Storm Water management, Hybrid vehicles, Tree Planting, Native planting,
                        Stream keepers and Trails. </p>
                      <p> We are also currently undertaking the development of an Urban Forest Strategy. The Urban
                        Forest Strategy will recommend direction and actions that will allow Saanich to optimize the
                        benefits of it urban forest by envisioning and enabling an integrated and sustainable approach
                        to preserving trees and enhancing Saanich's Urban Forest.  You can participate by taking the
                        on-line survey on our web site or plan to attend the Open House June 11. </p>

                      <h2>March 5, 2009</h2>
                      <p> Saanich, the community, its people, our politicians and our staff care deeply about our Parks.
                        For over 50 years Saanich Parks has been committed to 'greening' our community. Our mandate is
                        to work in partnership with the community to create a quality of life that supports healthy
                        lifestyles and preserves/protects our natural environment. I am reminded of the value and
                        regard placed on parks by the community and our elected officials weekly, often daily. These
                        beliefs are matched with a similar dedication and professionalism in the way the staff
                        approach their daily work. </p>
                      <p> Recently, I enjoyed an all too rare, 'walk in the park' with our Construction Foreman, Larry
                        Middleton. Larry has been with Saanich over 35 years and is a testament to this approach. With
                        great pride Larry walked me around Outerbridge Park (formerly Shangri-La). Our crews have been
                        working on a restoration plan for the site and have recently completed the pond loop trail. It
                        is now accessible to the community off Royal Oak Drive. No off street parking exists at this
                        time. </p>
                      <p> It is a wonderful oasis. Mrs. Outerbridge spent over 20 years to create her bird and nature
                        sanctuary and we are proud to now be the caretakers of this legacy. We have worked with her
                        trustee to develop the current state of redevelopment. Over time we will continue this work,
                        expanding the input into the community for any future phases of work. </p>
                      <p> In the meantime, I encourage you to explore this gem. If you ever wonder what one person can
                        do, while you walk the site think of Mrs. O. As well, I hope you notice the quality of work
                        and care taken by our staff in the restoration of this phase of the project. I am very proud
                        of the work done by our planning/design, arboriculture, horticulture and construction crews. </p>

                      <h2>February 2009</h2>
                      <p> Over the past few years Saanich Parks has been working to improve communications with the
                        community. One of the ideas our group came up with was the Blog, specifically the Managers
                        Blog. We thought it was a great idea, a 21st Century idea, a new e-connected way to reach the
                        community. The only hang up was writing it. So here is the first, maybe it's a New Years
                        resolution but I really think it's motivated by the recent loss of a great community builder
                        Frank Leversedge. He seemed to always have time for community, soccer, youth, & his family;
                        surely if he could do it I have time to write a Blog. </p>
                      <p> I met Frank when I arrived in Saanich in 2003. He was a part of the Cordova Bay Soccer Club.
                        I soon learned he was tiger, passionate about his game (soccer), his club, the players (young
                        & old) & the community. We began to work on ways to meet the needs of the Club as they had lost
                        the Trio fields. We were working on some ideas with the ultimate solution being the artificial
                        turf field that is now in use in Lochside Park. FELPS was Frank's baby.  It's said without him
                        it would not have happened. I agree. For more about Frank follow the link to the CBSC web site <a href="http://www.cordovabaysoccer.org">www.cordovabaysoccer.org</a> </p>
                      <p> I have been in the Parks & Recreation business over 25+ years in 3 different Provinces & in 5
                        different communities. I have made many mistakes but I learned a few things along the way too.
                        One of the things I have learned is that its people like Frank that build community. Every
                        community has them & in Saanich we are lucky to have many such folks. Community partnerships
                        have built most if not all of our parks. From the 4 artificial turf fields we now have (a 5th
                        on the way this summer), the lacrosse boxes, the ball fields including the Lambrick Park
                        dugout project this year. But it's not just the sport clubs we have many active Community
                        Associations & 'Friends of" organizations that are passionate about their community. They work
                        with our staff on many projects often challenging us in many ways but in the end we all must
                        remember we are building community. Frank's celebration of life at Lochside Park Jan 16
                        reminded me on this & much more. So to all those who help make Saanich a Healthy Community
                        thank you; I look forward to continuing to build safe, healthy & sustainable Saanich Parks
                        with you all. </p>
