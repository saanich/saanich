      <p>Saanich has followed an Integrated Pest Management Program (IPM) since the 1994. In fact,
        Saanich Park's staff participated in the development of the Provincial IPM standards for each
        category of pest management. We were also one of the first municipalities to submit an IPM
        plan to the Ministry of the Environment in 1994. In 2003, Council also adopted an Integrated
        Pest Management policy. A copy is attached. IPM is a decision making process using a
        combination of techniques to suppress pests. These techniques must include but are not limited
        to: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Planning and managing ecosystems to prevent organisms from becoming pests.</li>
        <li>Identifying potential pest problems.</li>
        <li>Monitoring populations of pests and beneficial organisms, pest damage and environmental conditions.</li>
        <li>Using injury thresholds in making treatment decisions.</li>
        <li>Reducing pest populations to acceptable levels using strategies that may include a combination of biological, physical, cultural, mechanical or chemical.</li>
        <li>Evaluating the effectiveness of treatments.</li>
      </ol>
      <p> Experience has shown that applying IPM methods eliminates unnecessary pesticide use, often
        reducing pesticide use by 60-80%. Or in the case of Saanich, we have reduced our pesticide use
        by 95%, since implementing our IPM plan. </p>
      <p>Over the years a number of IPM successes include:</p>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li> <strong>Purple Loosestrife - Biological Control -</strong> In the mid nineties we had a
          serious infestation of this invasive aquatic weed > Beetles obtained from the Ministry of
          Agriculture that feed exclusively on purple loosestrife leaves have managed to almost
          eradicate the loosestrife. </li>
        <li> <strong>Parks Greenhouse - Biological Control -</strong> The use of beneficial insects at
          critical times has resulted in a pesticide free operation. </li>
        <li> <strong>Giant Hogweed- Mechanical Control -</strong> In 2004 an infestation of this
          dangerous weed was identified in Saanich. We located and manually removed over 20
          locations of hogweed on public land, plus educate homeowners on the proper techniques for
          removal on private property. </li>
        <li> <strong>Complementary Planting - Physical Control -</strong> We promote and incorporate
          the use of native plants/ trees, plants/ trees that are attractive to beneficial insects,
          and plants/ trees that are ideally suited to the site conditions. </li>
        <li> <strong>Leaf Mulch - Physical Control -</strong> We have incorporated a leaf mulching
          program utilizing the mulch created from the residential leaf program. The advantages are
          numerous, including: excellent weed control, moisture conservation, builds the health of
          the soil, which in turn produces healthy plants that are less likely to be attacked by
          pests. </li>
        <li> <strong>Turf management - Cultural Practices -</strong> A combination of turf management
          techniques including optimal (computer controlled) irrigation, fertilization, aeration,
          top dressing, soil and tissue test analysis & mowing heights are adjusted carefully
          throughout the growing season to promote healthy turf. </li>
        <li> <strong>Weed Control Trials - Various Methods -</strong> In 2004, we tested 5 methods of
          vegetation control along fence lines to determine cost/effectiveness. We tested, Hot Foam,
          Round Up, Eco-Clear, Top Gun and mechanical control ('weed eater'). As a result we shifted
          to Eco-Clear (lemon juice/vinegar) </li>
      </ul>
      <p> For well over a decade Saanich Parks has and continues to demonstrate its commitment to
        environmental sustainability. The success of our IPM Program and the 95% reduction in the use
        of traditional pesticides is evidence of success. Consistent with Sustainable Environment
        Theme, from Saanich Strategic Plan, to be a model sustainable community and steward of the
        environment we will continue to work towards the elimination of all non-essential use of
        pesticides. </p>
