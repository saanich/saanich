      <p>Each year, Parks employees complete a wide variety of maintenance tasks at Parks, Beach Accesses, and roadsides throughout Saanich.&nbsp; Here are some of the services we provide that we get the most questions about, and what you can expect from us: </p>
      <h2>Roadside Mowing</h2>
      <p> Did you know that Saanich has over 300km of unimproved boulevard areas in urban and rural areas?&nbsp; The long grass and other vegetation along these roadsides is flail mowed to 2m from the edge once a year, between May and July.&nbsp; Additional cuts may be required at hotspots where sightline or traffic safety issues exist.&nbsp; Many factors are considered in the scheduling of the mowing routes, including&nbsp;geographical efficiency,&nbsp;the type of vegetation, ground conditions and environmental considerations such as wildflowers and fisheries concerns.&nbsp; If you have questions or concerns, please contact Saanich Parks at <a href="tel:2504755522">(250) 475-5522</a> or email <a href="mailto:parks@saanich.ca">parks@saanich.ca</a>.</p>
      <h2>Rough Mowing</h2>
      <p> Saanich Parks rough mows and trims over 60 undeveloped grass areas once a year.&nbsp; This program runs from late May through July.&nbsp; The timing of this mowing is set by drier ground conditions for our mower to access the sites, summer heat to reduce needs for additional cuts later in the year, and in some cases nesting birds or wildflower seasons. </p>
      <h2>Mowing Parks and Sports Fields</h2>
      <p> Parks and selected streetscapes throughout Saanich are mowed on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. We strive to reach all parks as soon as possible in the spring, but with the rapid growth and wet conditions, it takes a few weeks to complete the first cycle. Sportsfields are mowed 1-3x per week depending on a number of factors including best practices for turf health, ground conditions, and season of play.</p>
      <h2>Beach Access Maintenance </h2>
      <p>Saanich is fortunate to have an excellent public access to our shoreline. There are 28 designated ocean beach accesses to numerous coves, rocky headlands, and sandy beaches.Parks staff clears, moves or cuts logs to create a route to the beach in front of designated pathways and emergency boat launches. Beach logs area natural condition of the foreshore, and we do not routinely clear them in all areas. This work is typically done in April-May of each year after winter storms. Crews also trim back the vegetation alongside these designated beach access trails in May-June. </p>
      <h2>Parking Lot Dust Control</h2>
      <p> A magnesium chloride solution is applied to gravel parking lots in June each year to reduce dust.&nbsp; This product is a hygroscopic compound that fixes moisture from the air to the dust particles and resists evaporation.&nbsp; It binds fine dust and gravel, reducing the amount that gets airborne,&nbsp;to keep gravel surfaces stable and dust-free.&nbsp; This solution poses minimal health or environmental concerns.</p>
      <h2><a name="snowandiceprogram"></a>Parks Snow and Ice Program</h2>
      <p>The Parks Division clears snow and ice from access parking lots and entrances to our Municipal facilities. These facilities include 4 Recreation Centres, 3 libraries, municipal hall, police and fire stations. Our goal is to clear these facilities within 24hrs, depending on weather conditions. </p>
      <p>To accomplish this goal the Parks Division is equipped with a small fleet of equipment which includes front end loaders, front mounted snow blade, salter/sand truck, brine truck (salt water mix which is spread on the road to help with ice conditions) and numerous smaller pieces of snow removal equipment.</p>
      <p>Priorities are set during each snow event depending on weather patterns normally starting at Saanich Commonwealth Place with front end loader and hand crews, dividing equipment and hand crews to each location as required. For ice control or before a predicted snow event parks will send out its brine truck to apply an application of Brine to entrance ways and parking lots to help prevent ice from forming and to prevent snow from sticking to roadways. For prolonged ice or heavy snow events, Parks will use their sand/salt spreader to provide appropriate materials to driveways and parking lots.</p>
      <p>Parks has set priorities for its snow and ice control and will proceed as follows; </p>
      <ul>
        <li>First Priority 24hrs -Rec Centres, municipal facilities, Police and Fire Halls</li>
        <li>Second Priorities 24-72hrs-Side walks and main paved pathways.</li>
        <li>Third Priorities 72hrs+ -side walks, pathways and secondary parking areas. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We ask the public to be prepared and give a little extra time for travel and wear appropriate foot wear to avoid slipping and be wary of freezing melt water and deep slush. Please watch out for equipment and crews working and try and park out of the way of snow ploughs.</p>
      <p>To report a problem please call 250-475-5522 parks switch board.</p>
