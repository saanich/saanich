      <p>Playfair Park is considered one of Saanich's best kept secrets. It has a large grove of mature
        rhododendrons and azaleas, a Garry oak meadow, and a three hundred foot perennial border,
        considered by many who have seen it to be as impressive than Butchart Gardens. It is quiet and
        secluded - listen for the pair of Cooper's hawks nesting in the park.</p>
      <p> Area: Quadra<br/>
        Location: Rock Street or Cumberland Road<br/>

      <p>The warmest and driest winter in recorded history (C.B.C.) has brought spring to Victoria three weeks ahead of schedule.&nbsp; Each week brings more plants into flower. Bulbs that bloom in April and May are sharing the season with the March bloomers.      </p>

<h2>October 2009</h2>
      <p> Welcome to the last webpage for 2009. Fall arrived quickly this year. There is a chill in the
        air, an increase in cloudy days and rainfall. The sun still continues to shine and the flowers
        continue to bloom. </p>
      <img src="../../../images/parksrec/parks/aster_monch.JPG" alt="Aster X frikartii 'Monch'">
      <p> In the perennial border fall asters now make their appearance. These plants grow well in sunny
        locations with well draining soil. <u>Aster X frikartii 'Monch'</u> continues to bloom. The
        lilac petals with yellow centres cover a sturdy multi-stemmed 2 - 3 foot plant that never
        needs deadheading and always looks neat and tidy. If you are driving near Royal Oak and W.
        Saanich Road or West Burnside and Tillicum you can spot these hardy perennials planted in the
        traffic medians. A tall 6 foot lilac Aster (species unknown) with yellow centres graces the
        back of the border. It needs staking but is well worth having to provide good cut-flowers.
        Native to eastern and central North America Aster ericoides (Heath Aster or
        Farewell-to-summer) is covered with numerous small daisy-like white flowers on 2 to 3 foot
        stems. From a distance it forms a gypsophila-like cloud amongst the perennials. It prefers a
        sunny location in well-draining soil with low the medium moisture requirements. </p>
      <img src="../../../images/parksrec/parks/solidago2.JPG" alt="Solidago canadensis (Canada Goldenrod)">
      <p> Also in the aster family is <u>Solidago canadensis (Canada Goldenrod)</u>, a tall sun-loving
        perennial with plumes of tiny, yellow clustered flowers good for cutting. It is a native plant
        that tends to grow shorter in the wild. In the cultivated garden it grows almost 6 feet tall
        and needs staking. It is considered an invasive plant in China (Wikipedia). </p>
      <img src="../../../images/parksrec/parks/rudbeckia_goldsturm2.JPG" alt="Rudbeckia fulgida 'Goldsturm'">
      <p> <u>Rudbeckia fulgida 'Goldsturm'</u> is a Black-eyed Susan anyone can grow. It has 3 - 4 foot
        strong stems with flowers of golden orange petals with brown centers. It blends well with
        plantings of sedums and ornamental grasses. Just give it sun, well draining soil, and medium
        moisture. Like Solidago, it grows much shorter the less water you give it. Remember to
        deadhead to keep it blooming. </p>
      <img src="../../../images/parksrec/parks/colchicum_autumnale.JPG" alt="Colchicum autumnale 'Waterlily Double'">
      <p> Growing at the west end of the border is Meadow Saffron, <u>Colchicum autumnale 'Waterlily
        Double'</u>. Its flowers are large, cup-shaped double magenta-pink petals without stems. Plant
        the corms in a well protected location with sun and well drained soil. Also growing in this
        area in the same conditions is the iridescent pink Nerine bowdenii. It is a summer dormant
        bulb from South Africa. Divide bulbs February to March (BBC gardening website). </p>
      <img src="../../../images/parksrec/parks/aconitum.jpg" alt="Aconitum carmichaelii (Fall-blooming Aconite)">
      <p> At the east end of the border is the late blooming, blue flowered <u>Aconitum carmichaelii
        (Fall-blooming Aconite)</u>. It grows approximately 5 feet tall and requires some staking. It
        prefers moisture and some shade during the day. Like all aconites it is highly poisonous.
        Wear gloves when working with this plant. </p>
      <img src="../../../images/parksrec/parks/chrysanthem_umuliginosum2.jpg" alt="Chrysanthemum uliginosum">
      <p> If you are wondering what those tall white daisy flowers are at the back of the border are
        they are <u>Chrysanthemum uliginosum or Leucanthemella serotina (Giant Daisy)</u>. It is 6
        foot tall and requires staking. It prefers sun but can grow in shade. It needs average
        moisture but grows lanky with more. It makes a good cut flower. </p>
      <p> I always get asked about <u>Tricyrtis hirta (Toadlily)</u>. It is an Asian member of the lily
        family. In nature it grows at the edge of a forest. Its white or light purple flowers are
        unusual with dark purple spots. Its sturdy stems require fertile soil and moisture. Some shade <img src="../../../images/parksrec/parks/tricyrtis_hirta.jpg" alt="Tricyrtis hirta"> is preferable. </p>
      <p> I hope you have enjoyed the 2009 Playfair webpage and we look forward to continuing this next
        year. Thanks for your interest. If you have any recommendations on how we can make this site
        better please contact us at www.saanichparks.ca or 250-475-5522. Thank you to Kelly Mulhern,
        Janet Smith, and Amanda Irving for their help in getting these write-ups and photos on the
        web. See you in 2010!      </p>
      <h2>September 2009</h2>
      <img src="../../../images/parksrec/parks/salvia_patens.jpg" alt="Salvia patens and Salvia elegans">
      <p>The wonderful weather continues and fall is coming fast.</p>
      <p> The Rock Street entrance of Playfair Park has a small garden that greets visitors when they
        arrive. </p>
      <img src="../../../images/parksrec/parks/convolvulus_mauritania.jpg" alt="Convolvulus mauritania">
      <p> Behind the <u>Bergenenia</u> edge is blue <u>Salvia patens</u> 'Cambridge Blue', lime-leafed <u>Salvia elegans</u>, mauve flowered <u>Convolvulus mauritania</u>, marigolds and a purple
        Thai basil. The large squash leaves belong to the gourd 'Crown of Thorns'. (Already the cool
        nights are spotting the leaves with mildew.) </p>
      <img src="../../../images/parksrec/parks/playfair_gorp.jpg" alt="Garry Oak Restoration Project">
      <p> For blue flower seekers, the mexican <u>Salvia patens</u> is a tender herbaceous perennial. It
        takes easily from cuttings. Its tubers are easily lifted and overwintered indoors. A 1.8m (6
        foot) tall variety with large deep blue flowers is available as 'Guanajuato' (Wikipedia). If
        anyone has one I'll be willing to do an exchange. </p>
      <p> <u>Salvia elegans</u> (Pineapple Sage) is another Mexican plant with tubular scarlet flowers
        in late autumn. I have never managed to have it bloom in the garden. In mild winters it dies
        back to the ground and returns late in the spring. Plant in sun and in well drained soil. Its
        leaves smell fruity and can be used for a tea (Wikipedia). </p>
      <p> I am hoping Convovulus mauritania is the opposite of hedge or field bindweed. It survives mild
        winters, doesn't seed and is very drought resistant. Its roots don't travel and is easily
        removed from the soil from which it doesn't regrow.  So far so good... it is a beautiful
        plant. </p>
      <p> As you climb up the hill to the GORP site (Garry oak Restoration Project), you can see a new
        addition to the landscape.  A split rail fence has been erected to protect this ecologically
        sensitive area. Follow this link for more information on GORP. http://www.gorpsaanich.com/ </p>
      <img src="../../../images/parksrec/parks/kirengshoma.jpg" alt="Kirengshoma palmata">
      <p> The Cooper's hawks have left the area. With much fanfare of callings from the young ones
        through early August in all directions, especially in the rhododendrons, it is now so very
        quiet. I am reminded of my grandson's visit and how quiet it is since he left. </p>
      <p>In the border the late summer perennials are in full swing.</p>
      <p> Kirengshoma palmata (Yellow Waxbell), is a dainty yellow woodland perennial from Japan which
        is uncommon in gardens. It is a member of the hydrangea family. Growing conditions include
        shade, moisture, acidic soil and good drainage. Find a good home for it because it doesn't
        like to be moved. </p>
      <img src="../../../images/parksrec/parks/chelone.jpg" alt="Chelone oblique"> <img src="../../../images/parksrec/parks/lobelia.jpg" alt="Lobelia syphilitica">
      <p> For late summer color <u>Chelone oblique</u> (Red Turtlehead) is a sturdy 3-4 foot perennial.
        "Chelone" refers to the flower which is in the shape of the head of a turtle. It prefers shade
        but can take some sun, likes moist, rich acidic soil. </p>
      <p> The Lobelia has become a favourite genus of mine. <u>Lobelia syphilitica</u>, with blue flower
        spikes, grace the front of the border in partial shade. Used in the past to treat venereal
        disease it is also good for attracting hummingbirds. There are also tall bright red (with a
        hint of purple) and purple lobelias (varieties of <u>Lobelia x gerardii</u>). As long as they
        get moisture they are happy.  Protect them in the winter with a covering of loose leaves. </p>
      <img src="../../../images/parksrec/parks/ornamental_artichoke.jpg" alt="Ornamental Artichoke">
      <p> The <u>Ornamental Artichoke</u>, Cynara, is presenting a fine show of blue thistle flower
        heads that are heavy and need to be staked. Used as an architectural feature, its large silver
        leaves and stems lend itself very well to drought resistant plantings. Full sun and good
        drainage is  required. </p>
      <p><img src="../../../images/parksrec/parks/koelreuteria.jpg" alt="Koelreuteria paniculata"></p>
      <p> The colourful seed heads of <u>Koelreuteria paniculata</u> (GoldenRain Tree) dangle from the
        small tree at the west end of the border 'en masse'. It's seeds can be roasted and consumed
        (Wikipedia). </p>
      <p><img src="../../../images/parksrec/parks/anaphalus.jpg" alt="Anaphalis margaritacea"></p>
      <p> <u>Anaphalis margaritacea</u> (Pearly Everlasting) is a native perennial of dry, sunny areas.
        It is attractive in dry bouquets. First Nations people used it in a variety of ways: as a
        poultice, as  a skin softener for hands, or for treating influenza (Plants of Coastal British
        Columbia).</p>
      <p> <img src="../../../images/parksrec/parks/hibiscus_syriacus.jpg" alt="Hibiscus syriacus">      </p>
      <p> <u>Hibiscus syriacus</u> 'Blue Bird' is a shrub for late summer. Its drab appearance through
        most of the year is brightened for this short period. It is one of the "Cinderella"s of the
        plant kingdom. </p>
      <h2>July 2009</h2>
      <p> This month at Playfair you can hear the continuous, piercing cry of the Cooper's Hawks. The
        babies have left their nest and can be spotted perched on the lower branches of the Garry Oaks
        in the rhododendron garden. </p>
      <p> We are being challenged with keeping the rhododendrons well-watered through this dry spell but
        we are augmenting the underground irrigation system with sprinklers every weekday. You may
        spot two workers removing invasive species such as Hedera helix and blackberries from the area. </p>
      <p> The GORP site will soon get its split-rail fencing.  The red-listed Viola praemorsa will be
        one of the native plants protected by this initiative. </p>
      <p> The perennial border is now in continual color. The tall, fragrant white lilies at the eastern
        end of the border is Lilium regale (Regal Trumpet Lily) -- a much desired ornamental bulb. It
        will flower within the second year of seeding and is very easy to grow. It likes some sun,
        some moisture, and humusy soil. </p>
      <p> Eucomis autumnalis is the purple-leafed Pineapple Lily. Its dark strapping leaves are as
        attractive as its flowers which will appear later in August. Give it moisture, some sun, a
        well-drained, protected spot in the garden and it will reappear the following years. </p>
      <p> The white Aconitum napellus 'Ivorine' is elegant with its tall, spike like inflorescences.
        Like the blue Aconitum it is poisonous and was dabbed on spears and arrows in ancient times
        (Wikipedia). It prefers shade and moisture and needs to be staked. </p>
      <p> On the western sunny side of the border is the very attractive, drought resistant Romneya
        coulteri, the California Poppy. It has glaucous stems and leaves and is usually cloaked with
        large, papery white flowers with yellow centres. Keep it restrained in an area by itself. Its
        roots will travel with determination into your basement if it finds a hole. </p>
      <p> The native Eriophyllum lanatum, the woolly sunflower, is a butterfly attractor to the garden. You can find
        information on it in the Saanich Plant of the Month website. Another native plant, Epilobium angustifolium
        (Fireweed), is in full bloom in front of the rhododendron and azaleas. The bees love this plant. </p>
      <p> Two easily grown annuals can be spotted here. Helipterum roseum has delicate pink, papery
        flowers that can be dried for floral arrangements. Children (and adults) enjoy stroking the
        fluffy seedheads of the grass Lagurus ovatum 'Bunny Tail'. Both like full sun, well drained
        soil, and average moisture. </p>
      <p> If you like cycling, take the Saanich Greenway to San Juan and visit Sierra Park perennial
        border, which is in full bloom. Early in the morning you can catch a number of people
        performing various forms of Tai chi. You may even spot the three antlered bucks wandering
        through the neighbourhood together. </p>

      <h2>June 2009</h2>
      <p> What a June! After weeks of cold weather the heat hit and the perfect growing weather for
        plants began. I could swear some perennials (and weeds) were growing 3 inches a day. </p>
      <p> See if you can catch a whiff of the fragrant Lonicera periclymenum climbing up the Rock Street
        entrance arbour. </p>
      <p> The rhododendron and azalea garden was in its finest glory early in June rather than the
        traditional Mother's Day week. There are still some in flower. The native and ornamental bulbs
        which covered the ground have mostly set seed and dried up. Due to the unusual dry weather the
        drip irrigation system is being augmented by hand watering. So if you are walking the trails
        watch out for the sprinklers (unless you want to cool down from the heat). </p>
      <p> The male Cooper's Hawk found a mate. See if you can spot a tail in the nest. Chestnut- backed
        Chickadee fledglings can be spotted flitting amongst the branches. </p>
      <p> The perennial border is into its cycle of blooms. Many visitors have been asking about the
        ornamental onions dotted through the border. Allium christophii (Star of Persia) has a very
        large, violet "fireworks" ball and is 14 inches tall. Allium schubertii is taller (16 inches)
        with a smaller, tighter ball. Allium 'Globemaster' is 38 inches tall and has a very large
        purple sphere. </p>
      <p> In contrast to the more brazen and common Aquilegia 'McKenzie Hybrids' an unusual light yellow
        Aquilegia chrysantha lightens up the shadier section of the border. Oriental poppies lendt
        flashes of red, orange, scarlet, pink and plum to the border earlier on in the month but
        almost all have dropped their last petals and are approaching the dormant stage. Silver-bladed
        Helictotrichon sempervirens (Blue Oat grass) with its long seed heads contrast nicely with the
        small Festuca ovina-- both found in the upper, drier section of the border. </p>

      <h2>May 2009</h2>
      <p> Spring has come to Playfair with hot passion. The cold weather may have kept early flowers
        from blooming but with the onset of warm weather color is everywhere. Pink and white Ribes
        sanguineum greet you on rock Street. Yellow Erythronium 'Pagoda' can be spotted at the end of
        the evergreen Magnolia grandifloras. </p>
      <p> The Garry oak meadow is bluing up with camas (Camassia quamash and leichtlinii) along with
        spots of pink from shooting stars (Dodecatheon jeffersonnii). </p>
      <p> There seemed to be more Sisyrinchium douglasii in bloom this year. Fritillaria lanceolata -
        the chocolate lily, Pacific sanicle (Sanicula crassicaulis), buttercups and fawn lilies
        (Erythronium oregonum) are all blooming at the same time. It provided a beautiful show for the
        Mother's Day Concert that was held at Playfair Park on Sunday May 10th. </p>
      <p> The rhododendron and azaleas are far behind in color but there are some in bloom. As you walk
        the trails, see if you can spot the nest of the bushtit and the new Cooper's hawk nest in the
        oaks. A Playfair neighbour says the male hawk has been trying to attract a female and two
        females have already found him wanting. </p>
      <p> A large patch of pink Erythronium revolutum can be found near the trail close to Rhododendron
        "Yellow Hammer" - which is a big draw for hummingbirds. Trillium ovatum (Western trillium) is
        now turning pink from its original white. Fawn lilies, camas and other native bulbs are also
        in bloom. Two native dogwoods (Cornus nuttallii) are in full splendour. </p>
      <p> The perennial border is well into its show despite the cold winter. There were a few plant
        deaths (Eurphorbias and New Zealand Flax took a beating) and we are still waiting to see if
        some half-hardy ones are going to come back. Hellebores, dark orange Primula veris, lilac
        Primula denticulata, and varieties of Anemone De Caen--white 'The Bride' and magenta
        'Sylphide' are some of the plants in bloom. The double Caltha palustris 'Flore Pleno' shines
        in the sun while the coral/pink blooms of Pulmonaria rubra brightens up the shade at the
        eastern end of the border. </p>

      <h2>March 2009</h2>
      <p> Welcome back to Playfair Park. We look forward to showing you another year in the plant and
        wildlife here. </p>
      <p> It's March 2009 and we have had another snowfall. Despite the prolonged winter weather we are
        lucky to see an ever increasing amount of plants in bloom. The rhododendrons have started
        their season of color. A large pink one can be seen just off the Rock Street parking lot. As
        you walk the trails in the rhododendron and azaleas flower trusses can be seen ready to burst
        open. The leaves of camas and other Garry Oak meadow wildflowers are emerging at the GORP
        site. Purple hellebores provide interest in the eastern section of the perennial border while
        a variety of bulbs are blooming. The Cooper's hawks have been spotted flying through the trees
        - no nest has been spotted yet. </p>
      <p><strong>Spring is coming!</strong></p>

      <h2>September 30, 2008</h2>
      <p> Good-bye to the great late summer. Autumn has arrived and the rains have started. Perennials
        that bloom in early fall are in full color. </p>
      <p> Hemp agrimony (Eupatorium cannabinum) and Veronia gigantea are great border fillers with
        reddish-purple flowers. The former reseeds everywhere but is easily weeded by hand when less
        than 3 inches tall. If left to grow over  that height, and a gardening implement is required.
        Divide every two years to keep this plant in check. White Snakeroot (E. rugosum) is easier to
        maintain and does not seem to reseed. </p>
      <p> Purple pineapple lily (Eucomis comosa)  has a thick flowering spike covered with white
        star-shaped flowers which requires protection from wind and heavy rain. The stem snaps easily
        so stake it or use as a cut flower - it blooms for several weeks. Mulch in the winter to
        protect the bulb. </p>
      <p> Moon Daisy (Chrysanthemum uliginosum) is from Hungary. It is an elegant tall white perennial
        with grey-green leaves that is great for the back of the border. </p>
      <p> Toad lily (Tricyrtus hirta) is a rhizomatous perennial from the moist woodlands of Asia. Its
        quaint, star-shaped flowers are specked with purple. Requiring no staking and being a tidy
        plant it should be planted next to a path to be closely appreciated. </p>
      <p> Bugbane or Black Cohosh (Cimicifuga simplex/racemosa) is a North American member of the
        Ranunculus family. This is a tall, graceful plant with long spikes of cream flowers. <u>Botanica</u> notes that the rhizomes of this plant contain oestrogen-like chemicals that
        were used by Native Americans in childbirth and for menstruation problems. </p>
      <p> Aster x frikartii 'Monch' is covered with long-lasting blue blooms this time of the year. Its
        mounded shape, hardiness and tidy habit lends itself to any planting. You can spot some
        happily growing in traffic medians on Royal Oak and Wilkinson. </p>
      <p> Willow leaved sunflower (Helianthus salicifolius) is covered with sunny light yellow flowers.
        It makes a cheerful display to the middle of an island bed or the back of a border. Of all the
        perennial sunflowers this is my favourite... well worth the work to keep it in bounds. </p>
      <p> This pink fall flowering crocus (Colchicum autumnale 'Roseum-plenum') is a nice surprise in
        the garden when autumn hits. </p>
      <p> Several species of Salvias are still putting on a good show of color. The bright blue Salvia
        patens will require potting up for the winter and kept frost free -- water only when soil is
        dry. The annual Salvia horminum comes in bracts of blue, pink and purple. It is a wonderful
        border filler and reseeds itself quite nicely. </p>
      <p> Crocosmia x crocosmiiflora is a hardy bulb from Africa. Varieties in the border include
        'Solfatare' which is apricot-yellow and 'Emily Mackenzie' with light orange flowers. Crocosmia
        masonorum is the tall species with pleated leaves. </p>
      <p> Glory Bush (Tibouchina urvilleana) is the tender South American bush that everyone enjoying
        the border asks about. The purple to violet flowers cover the entire shrub. Its leaves are
        felty green. This plant cannot survive in the ground through our winter. Pot it up in the fall
        and place by a sunny window and water when soil is dry. </p>
      <p> This is the last page for the season. Hope you have enjoyed the Playfair webpage. See you next
        spring! Thanks from Janet Veld, Kelly Mulhern and Donna Wong. </p>

      <h2>August 20, 2008</h2>
      <p> The perennial border continues to put on a show.  The summer has provided a good place to spot
        butterflies. Woodland skippers, Admirals and Swallowtails can be seen flitting from flower to
        flower. Saanich has another large perennial border at Sierra Park in Gordon Head and Gorge
        Waterway and Maynard Park also have perennial displays. </p>
      <p> Blooming at the east end of the border is Cape Fuchsia, Phygelius, related to the Penstemon
        and Snapdragon.  Preferring light shade is Phygelius  'Sunburst' which has chartreuse leaves
        and pink flowers. Grow it to attract hummingbirds to your garden. </p>
      <p> Mimulus cardinalis, Scarlet Monkey Flower, is covered with yellow-throated scarlet flowers
        from summer to fall. Its drawbacks are sticky, brittle stems and sprawling habit. </p>
      <p> Two ferns add color and contrast to the shady parts of the border. Dryopteris erythrosora,
        Autumn Fern, is evergreen  and can tolerate drier soils. Athyrium nipponicum 'Pictum'
        (Japanese Painted Fern) have metallic-gray leaves with reddish tints. </p>
      <p> Agastache foeniculum, the tall licorice agastache is a self-seeding but easily removed and is
        a "perfect" plant to fill holes in the border. Upright and sturdy, its spikes of blue blend
        well with all perennials. </p>
      <p> Another tall plant, dark violet-blue Aconitum henryi 'Spark' (Wolfsbane) is a member of the
        buttercup family. For the superstitious, if the flower cast a yellow shadow on a suspected
        shape-shifter's chin, you had yourself a werewolf (Wikipedia). A warning, this perennial is
        poisonous. </p>
      <p> Polygonum amplexicaulis is one of my favourite perennials. Star qualities include the
        profusion of red flower spikes from early summer to late fall, leaves that are delicately
        heart-shaped and requires no staking. Bees continually swarm this plant. </p>
      <p> A beautiful self-supporting  pink windflower, Anemone x hybrida, is a delight to have in the
        border since it has not spread like other rhizomatous Anemones. </p>
      <p> A pleasing combination is phlox and Gooseneck Loosestrife, Lysimachia clethroides. The
        contrast of color and shape makes the maintenance effort worthwhile. </p>
      <p> Flowers like small suns, Heliopsis scabra, requires strong staking and much deadheading to
        maintain a good appearance. </p>
      <p> Tall Echinops spaerocephalum is a Globe Thistle that lends an alien-like atmosphere to the
        border. The slightly prickly foliage is gray-green and its bee-attracting ball-shaped flower
        heads are blue-gray.  These are good for dried flower arrangements. </p>
      <p> Growing next to orange Crocosmia is Liatris spicata, Gay Feather, which grows in the prairies
        of Canada. The purple, pink or white flowers are good for cut flowers and attracting
        butterflies. </p>

      <p> Finally we have summer and the garry oak meadow is going dormant and the rhododendrons and
        azaleas have finished blooming.  The perennial border is at its best now till late fall. </p>
      <p> At the Cumberland Road end of the border is the showiest of North American columbines,
        Aquilegia chrysantha (Golden Columbine). This long spurred, fragrant yellow flower reaches one
        metre in height and is more tolerant of sun and heat than other columbines. Its name is from
        the Latin meaning dove which some people say the flowers resemble. (Botanica, Raincoast Books,
        1998). </p>
      <p> If I could have only one lily in the garden it would be Lilium regale. From Western China it
        can grow to six feet in height with up to thirty blooms. It is heavily scented, reseeds easily
        and can flower in the first year. </p>
      <p> Monarda didyma (Beebalm) is a North American perennial herb with aromatic leaves used in Earl
        Gray tea.  Crush a leaf and smell! </p>
      <p> From the Iris family is Tigridia pavonia (Tiger Flower) an ornamental plant from subtropical
        Mexico. In striking shades of red with spotted centers its flowers only last a day. Like the
        daylily its blooms do appear in succession. </p>
      <p> Dierama pulcherima (Angel's Fishing Rod) is an evergreen perennial of the iris family. It has
        long grass-like leaves with flowers of deep pink arching from wiry stems like fishing rods. </p>
      <p> Lobelia tupa is an unusual perennial with erect racemes of tubular two-lipped flowers of dull
        scarlet with a white tip on its upper petal. </p>
      <p> Eryngium agavifolium has spiny strap-like leaves with six foot flower stems of small greenish

      <h2>June 23, 2008</h2>
      <p> Sunnier weather is finally upon us. The cold, wet spring has not kept the flowers from
        blooming after all. In fact many plants seem to have enjoyed the cool temperatures and extra
        moisture, putting on more luxuriant growth, with blooms appearing a little later than normal,
        and lasting slightly longer than usual. </p>
      <p> To the right of the Rock street entrance is Crinodendron hookerianum (lantern tree), a tall
        lime-loving evergreen shrub hardy in mild areas. It has waxy crimson urn-shaped and dark green
        leathery leaves. By the trellis is Pernettya mucronata, a lime lover covered with small white
        urn-shaped flowers. In the fall it is covered with large berries. This plant is unisexual so
        you need a male and female to get fruit. </p>
      <p> In the sunny side of the GORP site you may find remnants of the creamy-white flowers of the
        poisonous meadow death camas (Zygadenus venenosus). Among the rocks is the native rose, Rosa
        gymnocarpa, with its light pink petals and large yellow center. </p>
      <p> Every week the perennial border has something new to see. Below the loquat tree (Eriobotryia
        japonica) is Corokia cotoneaster, a shrub of yellow stars and angled branches. Geranium
        'Ballerina', an alpine perennial with small pink flowers with dark veins nestled in deep green
        leaves is at ground level. The pink with purple blotched Erodium glandulosum roseum, with
        filigreed silvery-green leaves fronts a small rock. </p>
      <p> Paulownia tomentosa, the empress tree, is a fast-growing, suckering hardwood with
        lavender-blue flowers. Its stems break easily when its large heart-shaped leaves are laden
        with rain or snow. The lilac balls of Allium 'Globemaster' contrast well against the large
        silver leafed ornamental artichoke, Cynara cardunculus. The flower of short Allium schubertii
        has an unusual star-burst shape. Polemonium carneum is a mat forming, spreading perennial with
        purplish pink flowers with yellow centers. Oriental poppies (Papaver orientale) have been
        electrifying the border with its' oranges and reds. An unusual burgundy coloured one, is
        Patty's Plum. Lupinus polyphyllus 'Russel variety' has spire-like racemes in purple including
        blue, red, pink, yellow or white. Tufted panicles of fluffy mauve flowers float above divided
        grey-blue foliage of Thalictrum aquilegifolium. </p>
      <p> A variety of perennial geraniums are in bloom. Geranium 'Johnson's Blue' has flowers of blue
        with a white center. Geranium platypetalum  is a clumping, rhizomatous geranium with blue
        flowers with dark, raised veins. The bright magenta flowers with lime colored leaves is
        Geranium 'Ann Folkard', good for weaving through early blooming perennials. A beautiful blue,
        double geranium (Geranium pratense 'Plenum Caeruleum') is also in bloom. </p>
      <p> People have been asking about the beautiful pink and white shrubs flowering in the back of the
        border. These are Beauty Bush (Kolkwitzia amabilis) and Mock Orange (Philadelphus 'Belle
        Etoile'). </p>
      <p> East of the arbour are multi-colored columbines (Aquilega vulgaris 'McKana Hybrids'). Dark
        Iris 'Eye of the Tiger' and light Iris ' Oriental Beauty' are elegant chalices in the border.
        The pink balls at the feet of Iris pseudoacorus 'Variegata' is Phuopsis stylosa. Rodgersia
        aesculifolia, a shade and moisture loving rhizomatous plant with plumes of white flowers has
        large horse-chestnut leaves. </p>

        under heavily laden branches of pink blossoms while the enticing fragrance of yellow and
        orange azaleas tickles your nose. Flowers range in color from pale pink with orange freckles
        to hues of red, yellow and white to blues of Rhododendron augustinii. Unfurling leaves with
        magenta bracts add interest. A large native tree Cornus nuttallii (Pacific Dogwood) is in full

      <p> Despite the cold weather an increasing number of visitors are checking out the blooms at
        Playfair Park. Some stay for lunch, enjoying the sun and quiet space. </p>
      <p> Sunny Fritillaria lutea maxima and sulphur-yellow Erythronium 'Pagoda' are in bloom at the
        entrance beds off Rock Street. </p>
      <p> The Garry Oak Restoration Project (GORP) site is slowly coming into its glory. Sharing the
        space with white Fawn lilies is Dodecatheon hendersonii, the magenta to lavender broad-leaved
        shooting star. Did you know it is in the Primula family? Search intensely for the dark purple
        flower buds of the mottled Chocolate lily, Fritillaria lanceolata. They can be seen at the
        base of some of the oaks. The saucer-shaped leaves of Miner's lettuce, Claytonia perfoliata,
        are bunched throughout the oak undergrowth. These make a good substitute for lettuce. The blue
        flowered Common camas, Camassia quamash, is barely showing color amongst the shiny, yellow
        buttercups. In a few weeks a sheet of blue will cover the hillside. </p>
      <p> The rhododendrons are at all stages of flower. Closed buds mingle with flowers barely open to
        those that have shattered and carpet the forest floor. Fragrance from our native Oregon grape,
        Mahonia aquifolium, scents the air. The large camphor tree, Umbellularia californica, is in
        flower. Crush a leaf and smell. A large patch of pink Erythronium revolutum is next to one of
        the paths. The Cooper's hawks are quieter now. The female is settling for long periods of time
        in its nest in the tall oaks. She may be brooding. </p>
      <p> The perennial border is waking up. Wine-red Pasque flower, Pulsatilla vulgaris, with its
        bright yellow stamens bloom at the sunny, west end of the border along with a single
        Fritillaria lutea maxima under the Garrya elliptica. White, magenta, red and blue varieties of
        Anemone De Caen will dot the border with color till fall. At the shady, east end of the border
        the yellow daisy-like flowers of Doronicum 'Little Leo' shine next to the forget-me-not blue
        of Brunnera macrophylla. The fragrance of hyacinths and narcissi continue to scent the air. </p>
      <p> Work continues with dividing and planting of perennials. Shrubs are being incorporated to
        enhance visual aesthetics in the winter and maintenance demands. Irrigation lines are being
        re-located to improve water coverage. </p>

      <p> Despite the few weeks of unusual spring weather the flowers continue to appear at Playfair
        Park. Our native flowering currant, Ribes sanguineum 'White Icicle' (the white variety) greets
        park visitors. </p>
      <p> The camellias are in full bloom. White fawn lily, Erythronium oregonum, has started to flower.
        Its recurved white flowers with yellow centers sit on slender stems that emerge from "fawn"
        mottled leaves. "Erythronium" comes from the Greek erythros for red, in reference to some
        pinkish-flowered species. See if you can spot the pink fawn lily, Erythronium revolutum. This
        species is confined to Vancouver Island and areas south (Pojar, J. and Mackinnon, A., Plants
        of the Pacific Northwest Coast, Lone Pine Publishing, 1994, p. 104-105). </p>
      <p> Also in the rhododendrons, look for Trillium ovatum. Trillium means in 3s referring to the
        leaves, petals, sepals and stigmas. The flower blooms early in the spring just as the robins
        appear or "wake up", thus the common name of Wake Robin. Its seeds are attractive to ants who
        feed on its oil-rich appendages and then discard the remaining seeds. This effectively
        disperses the seeds in dim forest floors (Pojar and Mackinnon, p.102). </p>
      <p> Purple hellebores are blooming in the perennial border as well as lungwort (the leaves are
        shaped like lungs) or Pulmonaria. The cool pink flowers contrast nicely with this variety's
        silver-spotted leaves. </p>
      <p> A Downy woodpecker and a Swainson's thrush were spotted in the grove of oaks where the Cooper
        hawks have built a nest. Hummingbirds can be heard dive-bombing potential predators. </p>
