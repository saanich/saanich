      <p><img src="/images/parksrec/parks/outerbridge_park_march09.jpg" class="float-right" alt=""> The property (3.8 ha (9.3 acre)) was owned by Mrs. Outerbridge from the late 80s to 2005. She
        spent these years creating  gardens, ponds and landscape features to create an oasis for
        wildlife, particularly birds. For a number of years the property was known locally as the
        'Shangri-La Bird and Nature Sanctuary' and was open to the public. Mrs. Outerbridge offered to
        sell the property to Saanich with the understanding that the park would be kept as a bird and
        nature sanctuary, and in 2005 her garden property become a park. </p>
      <p> <img src="/images/parksrec/parks/outerbridge_park_march09_1.jpg" class="float-right" alt=""> The park entrance (pedestrian only) is off of Royal Oak Drive, adjacent to 1181 Royal Oak
        Drive. The park has a number of features including trails, ponds and bridges. Some areas of
        the property have been planted with ornamental plants and others have been left in a natural
        state. Limited basic maintenance and clean-up was completed in the park between 2005 and 2008. In 2009 some improvements were made to the property including improving and
        resurfacing a main trail loop around the large pond, which is one of the main features of the
        park. The balance of the park and existing paths have not been upgraded and vary in
        accessibility. Although there is no parking available at this time, the improved pedestrian
        trail is now open to the public and is wheelchair accessible. </p>

      <p>Future plans for the park are yet to be determined but may include parking, an expanded trail
        system, interpretive signage, and an educational/interpretive centre. </p>
      <p> Saanich has partnered with the Horticultural Centre of the Pacific to share in the ongoing development and maintenance of the
        property.</p>
