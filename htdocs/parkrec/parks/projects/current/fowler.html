      <p>Consistent with the 2008 Council approved concept plan for Fowler Park, Saanich Parks and Recreation is pleased to say that Phase 1 of the Fowler Park plan is underway. &nbsp; </p>
      <p><a href="pdf/FowlerConceptPlan_CouncilApproved.pdf">Approved concept plan</a></p>
      <p>Phase 1 involves the creation of the parking area at the south end of the park. Benefits of starting the project here include a new trail head and connection to the Lochside Regional Trail, alleviate some parking concerns in the neighbourhood and provide an opportunity for expanded park use.&nbsp; Due to the subsurface ground conditions; geotechnical engineering consultants have recommended surcharging the area prior to finalizing the parking lot.</p>
      <p>The surcharge material is required to be in place for several months prior to finalizing construction. Our construction schedule for this year anticipates finishing later in the fall. The parking area will not be useable during the surcharging stage.</p>
      <h2> Update</h2>
      <p><strong>June 24, 2013<br>
      </strong> The parking lot was opened in April in time for the Jamboree Soccer tournament at Lochside Park.&nbsp; Along with the work being done on sidewalks and roadwork along Fowler Road, Parks will also be installing irrigation over the summer, and planting trees in late fall to complete Phase 1 of the project. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>March 27, 2013<br>
      </strong>Late March saw the surcharge material removed and stockpiled nearby for use with the road improvement project. The concrete curbing has been installed; once cured, staff will backfill with gravels, re-grade the parking lot, install wheel stops and put the finishing touches on the trails and landscape. We anticipate opening the parking lot for vehicles in the next few weeks.&nbsp; </p>

      <p><strong>December 21, 2012</strong><br>
  The parking lot has been built under the surcharge material, and we are waiting for settlement before finishing and opening the parking lot for vehicles.&nbsp; The connection to the Lochside Trail has also been roughed in, and will be finished when the final parking lot work is done.</p>

<p>Future phases of the park development will be dependant on Parks Capital funding resources. </p>
      <p>Saanich Engineering is also in the design stage for improvements to Fowler Road, for information see our <a href="http://saanich.ca/services/engineering/projects/index.html">engineering projects</a>.</p>
