      <h2>Overview </h2>
      <p>This park is named in honour of Major H. Cuthbert Holmes (1890 - 1968). Major Holmes was a leading advocate of planning for future public amenities throughout the Capital District, and was especially interested in preserving and protecting greenbelt lands along the Colquitz River. The park was developed in the late 1960&rsquo;s and early 1970&rsquo;s and maintained to a level consistent with a natural park. In 1986 the park was turned over to Saanich Parks, and in 1987 a significant portion of land was granted to the Provincial Capital Commission and subsequently leased to Saanich. </p>
      <p>The area commonly referred to as Cuthbert Holmes Park is actually a combination of Cuthbert Holmes Park (Municipal Park classification) and Tillicum Park (Community Park classification). Together they form 25.7 ha (63.5 acres) of park located in the Tillicum Local Area. For the purpose of this report this collective area is referred to as Cuthbert Holmes Park. Approx. 12 ha (30 acres) is owned by the Provincial Capital Commission and leased to Saanich for 99 years, expiring in 2086. The road right-of-ways of the Trans Canada Highway and Admirals Road function as part of the park, as does a small parcel (.05ha/.13 acre) owned by the BC Transit Financial Authority. The park contains important local and regional trail connections, a portion of the Colquitz River, and a variety of ecosystems and wildlife. </p>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <h3>June 13, 2012 - Open House </h3>
      <p>Saanich Parks held its third public open house June 13, 2012 to build on information gathered over the past 2 years, and further inform the park&rsquo;s Management Plan. When complete the plan will include a concept plan and management practices to achieve a responsible balance of recreation and ecological protection.</p>
      <p>This plan must address a number of inter-related factors that have negatively affected this Natural Park. Unrestrained access and unauthorized trails have resulted in soil compaction, loss of soil and plant understory, habitat degradation, and contributed to the spread of invasive plants. Areas heavily infested by invasive plants, and certain isolated pockets, harbour negative activities which discourage use. The lack of definition and facilities for appropriate activities has led to user conflicts and environmental damage in some areas.</p>
      <p>We&rsquo;ll be exploring how to define trails and identify appropriate activities, how to protect and restore sensitive areas, how to discourage negative activities, and how to accommodate legitimate users including nature lovers, families, dog-walkers, joggers and bicyclists. </p>
      <p> The plan is intended to protect ecological resources, balance a variety of activities, and improve public safety. &nbsp;This third public open house builds on the information we&rsquo;ve gathered during the last two years, including public input, Saanich policies, and environmental review. We are getting closer to finalizing the management plan for the park, and are interested in receiving community feedback. </p>

      <h3>June 18, 2011 - Open House</h3>
      <p>Saanich Policy review, community and stakeholder input, and an independent Environmental Review of the park have been completed. This information was shared with stakeholders at the June 18, 2011 Workshop and used to gather informed input. This input will be incorporated into a Concept and Management Plan for the park. </p>
      <p>A summary of this information is available in the Cuthbert Holmes Park Concept and Management Direction Plan 2011 Discussion Paper by clicking the links below.&nbsp; The full Environmental Review is also available for viewing.</p>
