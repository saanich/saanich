      <p> <img src="/images/parksrec/parks/beckwith1.jpg" alt="" class="float-right">Beckwith Park is within the North Quadra Local Area Plan and this park is classified as a
        Community Park. The main circulation route is an existing asphalt walk, linking the playground
        to the water park, tennis courts, parking lot, and accessible washroom facility. In 2000, "The
        Pond" water park was designed and constructed for children with all-abilities, between the
        ages of 2 and 8 years. The existing playground is popular and the existing timber equipment is
        nearing the end of its useful life after seventeen years of heavy use. </p>
      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <p> <img src="/images/parksrec/parks/beckwith2.jpg" alt="" class="float-right">To provide safe playground equipment to meet safety standards and reduce maintenance costs of
        repairing. This equipment is no longer manufactured and replacement parts are no longer
        available. </p>
      <p> To meet the community's needs, Parks needs to provide an inclusive playground for all ages and
        abilities. The play area at Beckwith Park is one of the best possible sites in the Saanich
        Park system to upgrade to a more accessible standard. </p>
      <h2>Public Process</h2>
      <p> <img src="/images/parksrec/parks/beckwith3.jpg" alt="" class="float-right"> Saanich Parks held the following community consultation process: </p>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li> A Focus Group, consisting of residents, North Quadra Land Protection Association members,
          Integrated Recreation representative, Saanich Parks and Recreation staff, discussed
          playground ideas and goals for this community park. Two meeting were held, one to discuss
          concept and park plans; the second to review play equipment submissions and selection
          process. </li>
        <li> An Open House was held at Lakehill Elementary, April 16/08 to review The Playground
          Replacement Project. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>New Equipment</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Structure for ages 2-5 years</li>
        <li>Structure for ages 5-12 years</li>
        <li>"Interactive Playhouse"  & "Ship's Bow"</li>
        <li>"Rotator": stand-on spinning unit</li>
      </ul>
      <p> The Protective Surfacing will be "manufactured wood product"; engineered wood chips were
        selected as this material will compact to provide an "accessible surface" for all abilities.
        The specifications of the chips are designed to reduce slivers with the length of chip and
        variety of wood.</p>
