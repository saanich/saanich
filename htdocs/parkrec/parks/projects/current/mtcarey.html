      <p>Mount View Park is <strong>now open!</strong></p>
      <p>The playground, trails, social hub, earth works, irrigation and hydro-seeding are complete. Trees will be planted in the coming weeks, and a community-maintained garden in the hub will take shape in the spring. The community can enjoy the playground, trails and hub throughout the winter, and we have put in temporary fencing to protect the soil and grass seed till spring. We hope the community enjoys the new amenities, and share the anticipation for warmer weather that will turn our new park green!</p>
      <h2>Overview</h2> 
      <p>This park was created by the development of the former Mt View School site at 3814 Carey Road (now referred to as Mount View Heights). It is classified as a neighbourhood park, is .54 ha (1.33 acres) in size, and is located in the Carey Local Area. The new park is proposed to include unstructured open space, a playground and picnic area, a seating plaza with shrub and perennial beds, naturalistic features, trees, and pedestrian circulation links. </p>
      <p>Saanich Parks staff have been working with the Mount View Colquitz Community Association and the Mount View Heights developers to coordinate the projects and develop a responsive park concept. In part, these efforts will ensure that Mount View Height&rsquo;s landscaping details and pedestrian circulation system coordinate with the new park. </p>
      <p>Pedestrian circulation routes have been designed to maximize the recreational potential of the neighbourhood without compromising the privacy of future Mount View Heights residents. There is a direct connection from Cadillac Road through the park and Mount View Heights to Carey Road, and secondary trail links from the park to both Carey and Homer Roads. The draft plan proposes to increase the amount of green space and enhance the pedestrian experience in the Homer Road section of the trail by narrowing a portion of the roadway to one-way traffic. This would reduce the area of asphalt, slow traffic, and increase separation between vehicles and pedestrians. </p>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>Following the public open house that took place February 1, 2011, a proposed concept plan was finalized for presentation to the Parks, Trails and Recreation Advisory Committee who subsequently  endorsed it.&nbsp; The Concept Plan was presented to Saanich Council and  approved on May 16, 2011.&nbsp; This concept now guides the development of the park.&nbsp; </p>
      <h2>Funding</h2>
      <p>The Capital Region Hospital District has contributed $175,000 toward the park, and Morguard Investments Limited has contributed $40,000. An additional $160,000 is available in the 2011 Parks Capital Budget, for a total of $375,000. </p>
      <h2>Construction Schedule</h2>
      <p>We anticipate that the park will be constructed in 2 stages, the first, consisting of everything other than the Homer Road right of way portion, will be completed in 2011. The works in the Homer Road right of way will be constructed in the future as funding permits.</p>
