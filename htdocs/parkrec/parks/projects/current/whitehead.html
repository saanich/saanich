      <p>We&rsquo;re moving closer toward completing Whitehead&rsquo;s approved Park Concept Plan. </p>
      <p>The new multi-purpose dock indicated in the approved Park Concept Plan has been installed, and will complement the new playground, trails, and riparian restoration work done in the last 2 years. All permits have been secured, and the dock&nbsp;was installed under the supervision of a Qualified Environmental Professional to ensure no negative impacts to the environment result. It will enhance general recreation by increasing access to the lake for wading and viewing, and allow easy launching for carry-in watercraft. </p>

      <p> Additionally this summer, parks staff with the help of some volunteers, removed the invasive Yellow Flag Iris. Over 120 square metres of iris were removed from the park shoreline. This was a&nbsp;difficult work as the rhizomes&nbsp;needed to be hand dug and removed to a compost facility. The area has now been covered with coco mat and reseeded with fall rye to control erosion. </p>

      <h2>Whitehead Park  Concept Plan      </h2>
      <p> The Concept Plan was presented at an Open House on June 9, 2009 and was endorsed by the Parks Trails and Recreation Advisory Committee on March 25, 2010. Council approved the Concept Plan on May 10, 2010, see the Concept Plan below.</p>
      <h3>Background and Vision</h3>
      <p> Whitehead Park is 1.21 ha (2.99 acres) and falls within the Rural Saanich Local Area Plan. It is zoned P-4 and classified as a Community Park. Whitehead Park offers unstructured recreation, and is intended for spontaneous use by all age groups via open space, play environments, picnic and seating areas.</p>
      <p>The park&rsquo;s original name was Lakeside Park, but in 1997, Saanich Council approved renaming it to Whitehead Park, as requested by Mr. George Lohr and Mr J. Whitehead (son of the late Albert and Nellie Whitehead). This was in recognition of the Whiteheads who were an early pioneer family in the Prospect Lake area, and who sold the land to Saanich in 1960 on the condition that it be established as a park. Many of the trees on the site were planted by Mr. Whitehead.</p>
      <p>In earlier times the park was a popular beach and swimming destination.</p>
