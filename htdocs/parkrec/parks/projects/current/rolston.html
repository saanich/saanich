      <h2>Rolston Trail &ndash; Pilot Project Results</h2>
      <p>On September 23, 2011, the District received a petition from the Friends of Rolston Trail Pedestrians to prohibit the use of bicycles on the Rolston Trail. Concerns over the multi-use of Rolston Trail have existed since 2005. In response to the petition, the Parks and Recreation Department initiated a Pedestrian Only Pilot Project for November 1, 2011 through to June 30, 2012</p>
      <p>All relevant Saanich planning and policy documents were reviewed, public feedback was received through letters, a self selected survey and a census style survey of Broadmead residents. </p>
      <p>At the heart of the issue surrounding Rolston Trail is a perspective that safety of pedestrians is compromised by the use of bicycles on the trail. The following summarizes the review of this issue:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Multi-use trails can provide a safe environment for all trail users provided basic trail development guidelines are followed.        </li>
        <li>The findings in the surveys are inconclusive with regards to the effectiveness a cycling ban would have on safety.        </li>
        <li>The survey provides us with information indicating the majority of trail users felt safe from accidents while using the trail prior to the pilot project.        </li>
        <li>The majority of survey respondents expressed support for multi-use trails.        </li>
        <li>A portion of the Rolston Trail subject to the pilot is part of the Safe Route to School for Lochside School.        </li>
        <li>The District of Saanich&rsquo;s philosophy of multi-use trails is widespread throughout key planning documents that provide direction to Council and staff. Except in rare circumstances, restricting cyclists is counter to current corporate policies.        </li>
        <li>When combining all this information with making minor trail improvements, user conflicts can be alleviated without the need to ban cyclists.&nbsp; </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Steering all the Centennial Trail and commuter traffic off the Rolston Trail is viewed as a solution to the issue and also keeps the East/West Trail Connector and the Royal Oak Trail visions intact. This should reduce the bicycle traffic on the Rolston Trail to mostly local residents, families and school children. The physical trail configuration also meets the policies, strategies and guidelines outlined in Saanich&rsquo;s key corporate documents. Minor trail improvements and public education will be undertaken to help mitigate trail conflicts ensuring successful sharing of the trail.</p>
