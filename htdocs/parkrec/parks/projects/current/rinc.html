      <p>Saanich Parks has numerous  facilities throughout our park system that meet the
        recreation/leisure needs within our 166 parks and over 750 Ha of parkland. However, much of
        the system is aging & in need of refurbishment. </p>
      <p> The focus of the grant was on our Playgrounds (54), Sport Courts (19), Sports fields (62)
        & Tennis Courts (35). Our staff conducted condition assessments in the spring 2009 to
        identify the priorities for this $3M program. </p>
      <p> Our priorities are based on these assessments coupled with parks that have current planning
        processes underway. Some examples include such parks as: Browning, Glanford, Layritz and
        Whitehead. The Lambrick Park tennis courts are also included. As our only 4 court facility
        they are a priority for lessons & events. </p>
      <p> A complete list of the parks and projects is available. (<a href="rincattchment.html">See
        attachment</a>). </p>

      <p>At Beckwith Park, the sport court, associated trail connections, tennis court re-marking and drainage work is complete.&nbsp; The sport court was made multi-use by including a hockey goal opposite the basketball hoop. The court was angled from its current position to avoid extensive earthworks and to make the connecting trail accessible. </p>
      <p>Saanich Parks worked with G &amp; E Equipment Rentals Ltd to install and improve the facilities in the Park. </p>
      <p>Re-marking of the Tennis Courts was done under separate contract and has been completed.</p>

      <p>At Blair Park, relocation of the sport court, removal of the old baseball backstop and removal of the picnic table is complete. The expanded  sport court includes a hockey goal opposite the basketball hoop.  The court has been angled from its current position to make better use of the space within the park.      </p>
      <h3 class="float-clear">Braefoot Park</h3>
      <p>At Braefoot Park, a renovation of Field #3 (southernmost field) is complete.&nbsp; This project included improved irrigation, drainage and sand/soil root zone for a grass field.&nbsp; Some&nbsp;re-grading&nbsp;and seeding of the grass slope around the south and west sides of the field&nbsp;was necessary. </p>
      <p>Saanich Parks worked with Michell Excavating Ltd. to complete this work. </p>

      <p><img src="../../../../images/DSC00492.JPG" alt="" width="350" height="263" class="float-right">At Browning Park, the sport court and playground indicated on the concept plan (Council approved May 2009) was in 2010 as well as associated trail work. A tree assessment indicated that a number of trees&nbsp; needed to be removed to address safety concerns and infrastructure conflicts. As such, the placement of the playground and sport court was slightly modified to utilize the park space in a more efficient manner. </p>
      <p>Saanich Parks worked with G &amp; E Equipment Rentals Ltd to complete this work. </p>
      <p>Our Urban Forestry staff completed detailed tree assessments to ensure the safety of both park users and workers. Unfortunately this assessment revealed a number of trees which were in poor health and/or were structurally compromised, in addition to those previously identified as problematic due to their location.  Approximately 30 replacement trees were planted in the fall of 20110, resulting in a net gain in trees for Browning Park.&nbsp; </p>

      <p>We asked kids to name our playground frog at the CommuniTEA Celebration at Browning Park on June 11. With the help of the community we&rsquo;ve made the difficult decision &ndash; &lsquo;Bowker Browning&rsquo; it is! This name is a combination of the 24 great suggestions we got, our thanks and congratulations to Maren, Keats and Simi!&nbsp;</p>
      <h3 class="float-clear">Copley Park</h3>
      <p>(<a href="pdf/Copley_RInCplayconcept11x17.pdf">Concept Plan</a> <img src="/images/logos/pdf.gif" alt="">)</p>
      <p> At Copley Park, two new playgrounds were installed in 2010 and improvements to the parking area were also completed. The small
        wooden playground on the east side was replaced within its current area with equipment designed for 2-5 year old children. The
        playground on the west side is designed for children 5-12 years of age. We&rsquo;ve also shown upgrades to the Colquitz River
        Trail on the plan and hope to do this work in the near future. </p>
      <p> Saanich Parks worked with G &amp; E Equipment Rentals Ltd to install and improve the facilities in the Park. Saanich Recreation
        continued its Summer Playground Program this year at Copley Park and the playground at Copley Park West was opened on June 30,
        2010, with the playground at Colpey East opening a few weeks later.</p>
