      <h2>Hazard Tree Assessment and Abatement Procedures Urban Forestry and Natural Areas</h2>
      <p>The Urban Forest is a vital component of our community. They occur as street trees, park trees, private trees and in natural areas or remnant forest stands. Our goal, as described in the Urban Forestry Strategy, is to protect and enhance the urban forest, however, our obligation is also to provide a safe setting for staff and the public. </p>
      <p>The <a href="pdf/MicrosoftWord-HazardtreeProceduresSaanichParksFinal.pdf">Hazard Tree Assessment and Abatement Procedure</a><img
							src="../../../images/logos/pdf.gif" alt=""> have been developed to provide administrative direction for Saanich staff as well as general information for the public regarding tree assessments and mitigation for tree hazards.</p>
      <p>These procedures outline the decision making process as we review the assess the condition of trees on public lands as well as those on private land protected under <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/living/pdf/treepreserve7632.pdf">Bylaw # 7632 &ldquo;To Regulate and Prohibit the Cutting of Trees&rdquo;.</a> <img

      <h2>Help us Take Care of our Boulevard Trees</h2>
      <p> Summer is upon us and the weather is warm and wonderful, but neighbourhood street trees are
        suffering and dying!  Just as we thirst for long refreshing drinks to replenish our bodies
        during the warms days, so too do the trees that adorn our streets in our neighbourhoods. </p>
      <p> Of great help to quench the thirst of your tree, is to remove the grass at the base of your
        tree and create a round "tree well", about one meter across, which you can then fill with
        mulch.  The "mulch tree well" will greatly assist in keeping water available for the tree,
        make it easy to mow around the tree and protect the tree from line trimmer and lawn mower
        damage. </p>
      <p> Please help quench the thirst of your trees by following these guidelines: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Water trees twice a week</li>
        <li>Water deeply and thoroughly each time a minimum of 15 minutes (20 litres)</li>
        <li>Water when it isn't raining</li>
        <li>Water during the cooler part of the day</li>
        <li>Water at low volume to eliminate water runoff</li>
      </ol>
