          <li> Group &ndash; may be along a boulevard or in a garden or park; </li>
          <li> Area &ndash; all of the trees in a specific area; and/or</li>
          <li>Landmark &ndash; usually a single well-known tree.</li>
        </ul>

<p>The Saanich Vision reflects the community commitment to the urban forest by preserving and
        protecting our native and significant trees.  These trees provide much of the beauty and
      heritage that we recognize as important in preserving our environment and quality of life.</p>
<p> The purpose of the Tree Preservation Bylaw is to prevent the unnecessary removal and damage of
        protected trees on all lands within the Municipality.</p>
      <p> <em>The information provided below is a condensed summary of the full Tree Preservation
        Bylaw.</em></p>
      <p> <strong>The Bylaw prohibits tree damaging activities</strong> such as topping or removal of any
        branch or trunk of a tree having a diameter of more than 10 centimetres (3.9 inches), cutting
        or damaging the roots, depositing harmful substances, blasting or fill inside the protected
        root zone of a tree.</p>
      <p><strong>The Bylaw also prohibits the removal of:</strong></p>

        <li> <strong>and any other tree over 80 centimetres (31.5 inches) in diameter*</strong> including significant trees. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <em>*The diameter of a tree is measured 1.4 metres (4.5 feet) above the ground. It can be
        determined by dividing the circumference by 3.142</em> </p>
      <p> Inquiries pertaining to Tree Preservation on private property, as well as requests work on
        public property, can be made to the Parks office at 250-475-5522. </p>
      <h2>Pre-Permit Criteria</h2>
      <p> Before you can receive a Permit as required by the Tree Preservation Bylaw No. 7632 you must
        meet minimum tree preservation criteria. </p>
      <p> THE PLAN AND INVENTORY All protected trees must be shown on a plan. The location of each tree
        must be accurately plotted showing the trunk diameter and Protected Root Zone (PRZ). An
        inventory list of the protected trees on the site is necessary to identify the trees covered
        by a permit. If there are more than four (4) trees present a separate sheet for the inventory
        should be provided. Inventories of four (4) trees or less may be listed on the plan. The
        inventory shall assign each protected tree a reference number that is to be shown on the plan
        and the inventory. The trunk diameter (accurate to 1 cm) and Protected Root Zone (PRZ)
        (accurate to .5 m) must also be shown. </p>
      <p> The diameter is determined by dividing trunk circumference at 1.4 m (4.5 feet) above the
        ground by 3.142. The PRZ is determined by multiplying the trunk diameter by 18. This
        calculates the radius of a circle around the trunk considered the tree's root area. </p>
      <h2>Protective Fencing</h2>
      <p> Sturdy reinforced snow or other substantial fencing must be placed around any protected tree
        on the development site. The fencing must be installed before your permit will be issued. The
        fencing must remain upright and intact as long as development occurs. The fencing shall be
        placed to the edge of the PRZ and staked to include the PRZ area inside the fenced area. If
        the protected root zone is inside the building envelope the fencing is to be installed along
        the building envelope line or the agreed upon construction zone line. </p>
      <h2>Storage of Materials on Site</h2>
      <p> All materials: Soil, fill, lumber, equipment, etc., that are to be stored on site must remain
        outside the PRZ and/or outside the protective fence area. </p>
      <h2>Site Servicing Locations</h2>
      <p> The in-ground site services must be located so as to minimize damage to protected trees. If no
        service access is possible without impacting protected trees then damage limiting techniques
        must be employed. In cases where removal if protected trees must occur to allow service
        installation, replacement trees may be required. A replacement tree bond is required to ensure
        tree planting will take place at a location on site with consultation with Parks Staff. </p>
      <h2>Blasting</h2>
      <p> Blasting causes more damage to trees than almost any other construction activity. An on site
        meeting with the blaster and owner/contractor must be arranged to appraise expected damage and
        discuss damage limiting techniques. This meeting must take place before a permit can be
        issued. </p>
      <h2>Arborists' Reports and Service</h2>
      <p> A report from a certified arborist will be necessary if you wish to remove a protected tree
        due to conditions that are not obvious on a visual inspection. This would include estimation
        of critical root loss and assessing soundness of trees with visible defects. A certified
        arborist's services will be required for tree pruning to clear for building envelope air
        space, utility line corridors and driveway access. Root pruning by a certified arborist prior
        to excavation will be required if a service trench or excavation is to be made in the
        protected root zone and conditions are determined unfavourable for preservation of the
        critical roots. </p>
      <h2>Offence & Fines</h2>
      <p> Tree damaging activities as defined in Section 9(a) of the Tree Preservation Bylaw are
        ticketing offences and subject to no less than a $100.00 fine for each tree. More serious
        damages or the removal of protected trees bring penalties of no less than $500.00 per tree for
        the first offence and $1,000.00 per tree for each subsequent offence. </p>
