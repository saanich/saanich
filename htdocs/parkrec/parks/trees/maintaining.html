      <p> By choosing to plant and maintain a tree you are helping enhance the Urban Forest. Trees
        provide many benefits that are often overlooked. Everyone appreciates the aesthetic beauty
        that trees provide, but there is so much more. Trees provide shade thereby reducing summer
        energy costs; they also remove carbon dioxide from the air we breathe and provide a carbon
        sink. By planting a tree on your property you have increased the properties value. </p>
      <p> Determining the location for the tree is extremely important to the tree's long term health.
        The ideal time to plant your tree is during the dormant season. In Saanich, the dormant season
        is generally November - March. Proper site preparation before and during planting, coupled
        with good follow up care, reduces the amount of time the tree experiences transplant shock and
        allows the tree to establish in its new location. Carefully follow eight simple steps, and you
        can significantly reduce the stress placed on the tree at the time of planting. </p>
      <ol id="spaced">
        <li> Dig a shallow, broad planting hole. Make the hole wide, as much as three times the width
          of the root ball, but only as deep as the root ball. On most boulevards the existing soils
          have been compacted and are unsuitable for healthy root growth. Breaking up the soil in a
          large area around the tree provides newly emerging roots room to expand. </li>
        <li> Identify the trunk flare where the roots spread at the base of the tree. The root flare
          will determine how deep the planting hole should be. </li>
        <li> Remove the burlap or container from the root ball. Inspect the root ball for any circling
          roots and cut or remove them. </li>
        <li> Place the tree at the proper height as predetermined by the root flare. The majority of
          roots on the newly planted tree will develop in the first 12 inches (30 cm) of soil. The
          planting level should allow for some settling (see diagram). </li>
        <li> Straighten the tree in the hole. Have someone view the tree from several angles to ensure
          the tree is straight prior to backfilling. </li>
        <li> Fill the planting hole gently but firmly. Fill the hole about one-third and gently pack
          the soil around the base of the roots. At this point, roll back the burlap on balled and
          burlapped root balls. Be careful not to damage the roots at this point. Fill the
          remainder of the hole, being careful to firmly pack the soil to eliminate air pockets.
          Add water as you pack the soil to help with this process. </li>
        <li> Stake the tree if necessary. If the tree is grown properly at the nursery staking is
          usually not required. However, protective staking may be required on sites where
          lawnmower damage, vandalism or windy conditions are of concern. Stakes should be removed
          after one year's growth. </li>
        <li> Mulch the base of the tree to form a "mulched tree well". We recommend leaf mulch for your
          newly planted tree. Mulch acts as a blanket to hold moisture, it moderates extreme soil
          temperatures and it reduces competition from weeds and grass. Mulch should be applied to a
          depth of 4 inches (10 cm). Remember to keep mulch away from the bark on the trunk of the
          tree. </li>
