      <p><em>Saanich Parks works closely with our user groups to ensure conditions are safe for play and
        that field use does not damage sports turf. Please contact your club representative to confirm
        field status prior to use.</em></p>
      <h2>Soccer Field Renovations</h2>
      <p>There are 19 grass soccer fields in Saanich supporting over 5,500 registered soccer players in 5 different home clubs.&nbsp; Soccer plays from September to April each year, and our crews have three months to restore the grass to be ready for the following soccer season and to support other community uses.&nbsp; We have an aggressive program to optimize topdressing, overseeding, fertilizer application, irrigation, aeration and a variety of other turf management techniques.&nbsp; Often, this requires the closure of soccer fields while the new grass takes seed, and we appreciate the understanding of the Clubs and the community in respecting these closures, if required.</p>
      <p>If you are interested in booking a field outside of the regular soccer season (Labour Day to March 31st) please contact 475-5522 to obtain a permit.</p>

      <h2>Information on Field Closures</h2>
      <p> Saanich Parks enjoys a strong relationship with our home user groups on field closures. We
        appreciate the expertise and discretion of dozens of club executives, field coordinators,
        league officials, and coaches to help assess field conditions before game time to minimize
        damage to the field and potential for injury to players by play during poor conditions. </p>
      <p> From time to time, conditions are such that Saanich Parks staff must close fields <strong>due
        to severe weather conditions</strong>, concerns for player safety, or maintenance
        requirements. </p>
      <p><strong>Please DO NOT play on fields if there is FROST, SNOW, STANDING WATER or UNSAFE CONDITIONS.</strong></p>
      <p>Parks staff (and user groups) consider the following in determining the status of sports
        fields: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Weather forecast (heavy rain, snow or freezing?)</li>
        <li>Maintenance scheduling</li>
        <li>Type of use</li>
        <li>Scheduled tournaments and club needs</li>
        <li>Time of year (early or late season)</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Saanich Parks works closely with the clubs to minimize impact to schedules, realizing that
        field closures impact thousands of players and that lost games are difficult to make up. We
        also realize that fall/winter sports are not necessarily fair-weather sports, and players (and
        parents) are accustomed to playing in rainy or cold conditions. </p>
