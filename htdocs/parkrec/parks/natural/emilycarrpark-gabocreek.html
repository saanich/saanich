      <p>Collaboration between Saanich Public Works &amp; Parks Divisions has enhanced the ecological integrity in Gabo Creek! </p>
      <p>The day lighted portion of Gabo Creek is located in Emily Carr Park. The Public Works Creek and Waterways Crew discovered that the inlet pipes that flow into Emily Carr Park were submerged under water due to silt build up. The crews put a plan together that was reviewed by a qualified environmental professional. This plan included installing two temporary silt fences prior to removing the silt.&nbsp; The silt was removed with a hydro-vac in the eastern arm of the creek. The hydro-vac was the preferred method over an excavator because it reduces the impact to the vegetation in the riparian area. Following this work, the Creek and Waterways Crew found that the northern arm of the creek was also inundated with silt. </p>
      <p>The Parks department assisted this process by trimming riparian trees and removing Himalayan blackberry bushes for excavator access to the creek. Environmentally sensitive oil was utilized in the excavator, and 40 loads of silt were removed from the north-south arm of the creek. Once excavation was completed, the path was re-instated, topsoil was delivered and the disturbed area was reseeded.</p>

      <p>The combined crews utilized bio-engineering to assist with slope stability and reduce the overland run-off, including silt. This involved planting Willow wattle fences in the area that was washed out and utilized three existing willow trees behind the new Willow waddles. In the near future, native vegetation will be planted on the banks of Gabo Creek to further protect the banks and to provide cover for invertebrates within the creek. </p>
