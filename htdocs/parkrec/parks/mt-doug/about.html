      <h2>Mount Douglas Park has Something for Everyone</h2>
      <p>Mount Douglas Park provides year-round activities and experiences and has long been a destination for visitors to come for 
        
        
  &nbsp;inspiration  and enjoyment.</p>
      <p>The Park is 188 hectares in size with over 21 kms of trails to explore.</p>
      <p>The largest urban forest on the Saanich Peninsula is preserved within the park 


boundaries. Its regional significance remains high because of the diverse habitats.</p>
      <p>A popular feature of the park is the extensive trail system with the names of the early settlers and farms in the area. Some trails may well have been established by them. A variety of trails lead through the forest, up to the spectacular view at the mountain summit, and down to the secluded, sandy beach.</p>
      <p><img src="../images/IMG_6381.JPG" alt="explore" width="250" height="188"><img src="../images/IMG_6365.JPG" alt="view" width="250" height="187"><em><strong><img src="../images/HPIM5122.JPG" alt="mount douglas playground" width="250" height="188"></strong></em><em></em></p>
      <p><em><strong>Explore...<br>
      </strong></em>Either an easy stroll or a strenuous climb - there is much to see.
      Look for marine life on the beach; wildflowers, birds and animals 
      in the forest fish in the creek; and lizards and lichens among the rocks at the top.</p>
      <p><strong><em>View...<br>
      </em></strong>Enjoy the serenity of the ocean, with a view of Mount Baker; 
      watch for seals, orcas and waterfowl passing by; and 
      search out familiar landmarks from the outstanding 360 degree 
      panoramic view from the summit.</p>
      <p class="highlight-box"><strong>Churchill Drive</strong> - the paved road leading to the summit is closed to vehicular traffic in the mornings seven days a week. Until noon each day, the road functions as a multi-use trail which promotes a more active, enjoyable leisure experience for pedestrians and cyclists.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Picnic...<br>
      </strong></em>Book your family reunion or special group events - Mount Douglas Park features a large picnic area complete with facilities including accessible washrooms and open field area with a backstop for activities.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Play...<br>
      </strong></em>Enjoy the beach, the playground and a group game.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Photograph or Paint...<br>
      </strong></em>Capture the landscape, the seasonal colours of the plants and the variety of birds and animals.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Ride or Run...<br>
      </em></strong>Make your way to the summit or connect to the regional trail systems.</p>
      <h3>Park/Trail Etiquette</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Respect plants and wildlife.</li>
        <li>Respect private property adjacent to the trail.</li>
        <li>Do your part to keep our parks and trails clean. Put litter in the waste containers. </li>
        <li>Horses are allowed unless otherwise posted. Respect horseback riders as horses may startle easily.</li>
        <li>Dogs must be kept under control. Pick up after your pet.</li>
        <li> Dogs are not permitted on the beach or around the playground and lower/beach parking area ("area bounded by Cordova Bay Road, Ash Road, Douglas Creek, the natural boundary of the ocean and the northwesterly boundary of the park, EXCEPT the asphalt road surface lying to the northwest of the picnic area between the two gates" - Animal Bylaw).</li>
        <li>Cycling is permitted on paved roads only, not park trail.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Many fragile ecosystems exist within the park - from the rock outcrops at the summit to down between the tide lines on the beach. Please treat Mount Douglas Park with respect and preserve these sensitive habitats. Take nothing but photographs; leave nothing but footprints. Enjoy!      </p>
