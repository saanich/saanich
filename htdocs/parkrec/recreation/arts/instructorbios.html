      <h3><a name="Stacey"></a>Stacey Van Drunen </h3>
      <p>My main goal is for students to have tons of fun while learning the basics of art, drawing and design! I am experienced in teaching the fundamentals of art to students of all ages. I strongly believe that my role as an art teacher is to encourage my students to be creative, believe that they can do whatever they set their minds to and create worlds that are just as unique and special as they are! This means that I'm really easygoing about how my students go about applying the techniques that I teach them. I will teach them different concepts and tools that will help them harness different aspects of drawing and art, but they are completely free to take those things wherever their creative minds lead them! I also strongly believe in individualized teaching and coaching. The bottom line is that art should always be FUN and I make every effort to keep it that way, but still with a lesson plan and a general goal in mind!  </p>
