      <p>Fire prevention reduces loss of life and property resulting from fire by eliminating fire hazards and enforcing the rules and regulations that are necessary for public safety. The Saanich Fire Department's fire prevention program includes fire investigations, public building inspections, code enforcement and public education initiatives.</p>
      <h2>Open Air Burning Ban Lifted for RURAL Saanich </h2>
      <p> The Ban on Open Air Burning in <strong>Rural </strong>Saanich has been lifted as of October 29, 2012.</p>
      <p><em><strong>A complete burning ban remains in effect within the Urban containment boundary.</strong></em></p>
      <p>Please direct any related questions to the Fire Prevention Division at 475-5503.</p>
      <h2>Smoke Alarm Campaign</h2>
      <h4> Saanich Fire Department will be conducting a community-based smoke alarm campaign beginning in October. </h4>
      <p> This campaign is part of the Fire Chiefs Association of BC movement in 2012 to achieve the goal of a &ldquo;<em>working smoke alarm</em>&rdquo; in every home.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Smoke alarms are critical to home fire safety because they alert us to fire in its early stages. Even more important, they can alert us to a fire when we are most vulnerable - when we are asleep at night. According to the Office of the Fire Commissioner, a majority of home fire victims die in homes without a working smoke alarm. The smoke alarms were not working, usually because batteries were dead, disconnected, or missing.</p>
      <p><em>&ldquo;The presence of a working smoke alarm doubles your chances of surviving a fire, and our program will ensure that more of our residents have that protection,&rdquo;</em> states Jerry Tomljenovic, Captain of PreFire Planning and Public Education. </p>
      <p> If you, or someone you know has difficulty checking, installing or maintaining their smoke alarm, contact the Saanich Fire Prevention Division for assistance at (250) 475-5500.<a name="Open"></a></p>
      <h2>Smoke kills people</h2>
      <p> A smouldering fire may go undetected for hours, especially when people are asleep. Such a fire
        will continue developing, giving off smoke and gases which may not be visible but which
        consume oxygen and replace it with toxic gases, such as carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and
        hydrogen cyanide. </p>
      <p> These killer agents can take effect before a sleeper is disturbed. An early warning system --
        a <a href="alarms.html">smoke alarm</a> -- is considered one of the most effective defences
        against this situation. </p>
      <h2>Smoke Alarms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Purchase one or more <a href="alarms.html">smoke alarms</a>.</li>
        <li>Install alarms properly.</li>
        <li>Identify escape routes and practice escaping.</li>
        <li>Maintain your alarms.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How do smoke alarms work?</h3>
      <p> Smoke alarms work by sensing the rising smoke from a fire and sounding an alarm. They can
        detect smoke far from the origin of the fire. Smoke alarms are most valuable at night,
        alerting family members to the presence of fire when they are asleep. Smoke alarms can alert
        the occupants in the early stages of a fire while conditions are such that a safe evacuation
        is still possible. </p>
      <h3>Maintain your smoke alarm</h3>
      <p> Smoke alarms should be cleaned at least once every six months. They are to be tested at least
        once a year, and battery powered alarms are to have new batteries installed at least once a
        year. It is recommended that smoke alarms older than 10 years be replaced. </p>
      <h3>Practice your escape</h3>
      <p> Now that you have your first line of defence, your family should <a href="escape.html">have an
        escape plan</a>, because getting out may not be as easy as walking out the door. Plan and
        practice exit drills with at least two ways out from every room of your home. Make the escape
        drills as realistic as possible - pretend that certain exits are blocked, that there are no
        lights and that hallways are filling with smoke. Teach everyone to recognize the sound of the
        smoke alarm and what to do when they hear it. Never return to a burning building under any
        circumstance, and use a neighbour's phone for the emergency call to 9-1-1. Here are some key
        things to remember: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you encounter smoke, use your alternate exit.</li>
        <li>If you must escape through smoke, crawl low where the air is cooler and cleaner.</li>
        <li> If your clothing catches on fire - DO NOT RUN - instead STOP, DROP to the ground and ROLL
          to smother the flames. </li>
      </ul>
