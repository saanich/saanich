      <h2>Introduction</h2>
 Boulevards are the lands within a road allowance that are not used for the travelled portion
					    	of the road or for sidewalks. Most residential property owners can determine, at least
					    	approximately, where their property ends and the municipal boulevard begins, by the location
					    	of their water meter. The meter will usually be a foot or so outside the property line. The <a href="/services/gis/index.html">Saanich Geographical Information System</a> (GIS) is also very useful in
					    	determining the extent of a boulevard.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Bylaws and Policies for Use of a Boulevard</h2>
                            
The boulevard is owned by Saanich and is used for underground and overhead utilities and for
							sidewalks. Institutional, commercial and multi-family properties usually provide approved
							landscaping and other improvements to the boulevard as a condition of development, and they
							maintain them afterwards.

<p>The main bylaws and policies governing the use of boulevards are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="pdf/Bylaw4806ManagementandProtectionofBoulevards.pdf">Boulevards Management Bylaw</a> (to regulate the provision, management and
    protection of boulevards) </li>
  <li> <a href="pdf/streets_traffic_bylaw.pdf" target="_blank">Streets and Traffic Regulation
    Bylaw</a> <img src="../../images/logos/pdf.gif" alt="PDF"> (to regulate the streets and traffic
    within the Municipality of Saanich) </li>
  <li> <a href="pdf/boulevard_tree_policy.pdf" target="_blank">Boulevard Tree Policy</a> <img src="../../images/logos/pdf.gif" alt="PDF"> (to regulate the installation and maintenance of

  <li> <a href="pdf/driveway_access_bylaw.pdf" target="_blank">Driveway Access Bylaw</a> <img src="../../images/logos/pdf.gif" alt="PDF"> (to regulate the means of access to and from a
    highway) </li>
</ul>

  precedence over municipal bylaws and policies.</strong> </p>
<h2>Application Form</h2>
 Click here if you wish to apply to construct a <a href="../../business/permits/buildperms.html#driveway">Driveway Access</a> across a boulevard.
</p>
<p> You do not require a boulevard permit if you want to install grass or sod, as long as no
  pre-existing vegetation is removed. However, if you wish to alter the grades, either by
  cutting or filling, before seeding or sodding, you will require a permit. </p>
<p> Residential property owners may or may not be granted permission to use the boulevard adjacent
  to their property. The starting point is to submit an <a href="pdf/BoulevardApplicationPermitMarch2011.doc"
					    	target="_blank">Application for a Boulevard Permit</a> <img src="../../images/logos/pdf.gif" alt="PDF"> including sketches or photos to illustrate what you wish to do. The following sections provide
  information on what is considered in reviewing an application. </p>
<p>The most common applications for the use of a boulevard are for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Landscaping -- Plantings must:</li>
</ul>
<p>Be from an <a href="pdf/ApprovedPlantListApr2009.pdf">Approved List</a> or with approval from Saanich.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be located sufficiently back from the travelled portion so as to not cause a traffic or pedestrian safety issue (at least 1.5 metres where possible).&nbsp; Be located sufficiently back from a sidewalk so as to not encroach on the sidewalk.&nbsp; Not interfere with existing trees.&nbsp; Not interfere with or obstruct the visibility of or access to public utilities such as water meter boxes, manholes, fire hydrants, etc.&nbsp; Not be so large or in a configuration such as a hedge that they visually separate the area from the rest of the streetscape and make it appear to be a private part of the property.&nbsp; Be maintained by the permit holder so that they are not a traffic or pedestrian safety or aesthetic issue.</p>
<p>Proposed landscaping beds that incorporate river rocks will need special approval to ensure that they pose no safety issues.&nbsp; The area will also need to be maintained by hand to a high standard to prevent weeds, with no application of pesticides.</p>
<p>To promote water conservation, any irrigation system should be low flow drip irrigation.</p>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="pdf/StandardConditions--BoulevardPermits.doc">Standard Conditions</a> for information on checking for underground utilities before digging, and for potential damage to improvements from future municipal work. </p>
<ul>
  <li> Devices to stop vehicle encroachment:</li>
</ul>
<p>  The prime considerations for devices to stop vehicle encroachment are safety and 
  impact on utilities. We encourage plantings, particularly in raised beds set back 
  sufficiently from the edge of the travelled portion.&nbsp; 
  Fences or individual rocks set on the boulevard will not be approved. Normally, only the Saanich Parks Dept. plant or prune trees on the boulevards. In order to ascertain which trees might be appropriate for planting on the Municipal boulevard our Parks Dept. have released a <a href="documents/BoulevardPreferredListofTrees.pdf">Preferred List of Trees</a> list. Please contact Rob Hughes, Urban Forestry Supervisor, Saanich Parks at 250-475-5532 for tree planting information and any cost sharing propgrams that may be available. </p>
<p>Some uses that will likely <strong>NOT</strong> be approved include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Boulevard parking areas.</li>
  <li>Rocks to stop vehicle encroachment</li>
  <li>Fences</li>
  <li>Structures such as sheds</li>
  <li>Retaining walls</li>
  <li>Hedges</li>
</ul>
