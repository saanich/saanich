      <p>The area of interest for this project is a 0.65km stretch of Tillicum Road between Carey Road and the Trans Canada Highway within the District of Saanich. This stretch is a major road that provides access to the Trans Canada Highway and the Galloping Goose Trail. Commercial and institutional properties are located at the north end of the road, with residential properties located southwards.</p>
      <p>This section of Tillicum Road is within the <a href="http://saanich.ca/business/lap/carey.html">Carey Local Area Plan</a> - a plan that will help guide the future of this neighbourhood. Based on this plan, the overall &quot;community vision&quot; is one that utilizes social and environmental criteria for major roads in the neighbourhood. This includes providing safe access to pedestrian and cycling facilities near adjacent highways to downtown, preserving and enhancing the passive and active recreation opportunities offerred within parks, and maintaining nearby environmental attributes such as Gary Oak meadows and Colquitz River tributaries </p>
      <p>The new design of Tillicum Road will meet the needs of motorists, cyclists and pedestrians of all ages, as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving storm water quality. The new design will improve safety, be more inviting for all users of the Tillicum Road corridor and reflect the neighbourhood vision as defined in the Carey Local Area Plan.</p>
      <p>Please visit this page in the future for more information on this project. The District of Saanich will update this page when project milestones, concept designs and open house dates become finalized.</p>
