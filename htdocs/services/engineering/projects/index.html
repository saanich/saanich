      <h2>Cedar Hill Road -- Hopesmore to Feltham </h2>
      <p>This project will see the installation of concrete curb and sidewalk, as well as bike lanes on Cedar Hill Road between Hopesmore Drive (the southerly intersection) and Feltham Road. Working in co-operation with the development at 4009 Cedar Hill Road, the curb, sidewalk and bike lanes will be extended to Feltham Road. The existing lane configuration will be revised to provide bike lanes on both sides of the street and the existing on street parking lane will be adjusted in places with on street parking bays on the east side of Cedar Hill Road included in the design. </p>

      <h2>Complete Streets Conceptual Design for 2012</h2>
      <p>Complete streets balance the modes of transportation, an initiative the District of Saanich plan on dramatically increasing over the next 25 years. Three road corridors are currently in the conceptual design stage of this project: Cook Street, Tillicum Road and Glanford Avenue. Two complete street concepts for each of these roads  will be generated and a public open house will follow to gather comments, at a later date. <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/completestreets">Read more... </a></p>

      <h2>Fowler Sayward Hunt Intersection </h2>
      <p>This intersection has come to the attention of staff due to some unique features associated with it. These include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the 90 degree bend;</li>
        <li>the slight grade around the curve;</li>
        <li>the split nature of Hunt Road at both ends of the curve and the affect that has on the banking of the roadway around the curve (super-elevation), especially for north bound vehicles.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Anecdotal and accident information suggests a higher risk of accident when traversing intersection/curve, especially in poor weather conditions when visibility and/or road conditions allow no buffer for correction.</p>
      <p>The project will realign the intersection to a conventional &quot;Tee&quot; configuration. The Hunt Road leg will be regarded to provide safe access to and from Fowler and Sayward Roads with improved pedestrian access to the Lochside Trail.</p>
      <p>The project also includes concrete sidewalks and bike lanes on the approaches to the intersection and improvements to the south bound bus stop on the west side of Fowler Road, which is consistent with community and Council&rsquo;s desire to enhance alternate modes of transportation.</p>
      <p>Concurrent to this work, the Parks Department is planning the construction of a gravel parking lot at the south end of Fowler Park to handle the overflow from Lochside Park during high park use events. Engineering and Parks will be working together to ensure the respective designs and subsequent construction is co-ordinated and compatible.      </p>

      <h2><a name="gorgeroadclosure"></a>Gorge Road West Closure -- Important Update -- October 2, 2013 </h2>
      <p>Due to unforeseen construction issues, sewer work along Gorge Road will continue beyond the originally estimated completion date. Construction is now expected to be complete in November of this year. Until such time that the sewer work is completed, Gorge Road West from Tillicum Road to Admirals Road will remain closed except to local residents and bus traffic. </p>
      <h2>Gorge Road West Closure -- July 2nd to September 30th, 2013</h2>
      <p>A new 1700m sanitary gravity and force main sewer system will be installed by Windley Contracting Ltd. starting July 2nd, 2013 along Gorge Road between Tillicum and Admirals Roads. The new sewers will be installed dry (no flow introduced yet) and will replace the aged system that is currently serving the area. Flow will be switched over from the existing aged system to the new system upon completion of a new central sewage lift station which will be located at the intersection of Austin Avenue and Gorge Road (<a href="../../../living/about/news/2013/austin-pump-station-open-house.html">see Austin Pump Station Public Input</a>). Construction of the station is expected to start next year. It will replace two existing stations that did not meet current electrical and environmental standards, and that contained aged mechanical and electrical equipment.</p>

      <h2>Interurban Sidewalk Project </h2>
      <p>This project includes concrete sidewalk and bike lanes to connect Strawberry Vale to Camosun College. The project will be constructed in two phases. The first phase is scheduled to take place in fall of 2013 and the second phase is panned for 2014. </p>
      <p>To implement bike lanes and sidewalk construction, widening of the road is required. This will require the construction of a retaining wall between Roy Road and North Road. This&nbsp; will be done in Phase 1 of the project; Phase 2 will complete the gap between existing sidewalks connecting Camosun College to North Road. Phase 2 of the project also includes the installation of a new concrete bus stop pad on the north bound of Interurban Road close to Charlton Rd. </p>

<h2>Saanich Road at Greenridge </h2>
      <p>This project involves the stabilization of the roadway embankment above the Swan Lake/Christmas Hill Nature Sanctuary gravel pathway opposite Greenridge Crescent.&nbsp; Improvements to the existing bus stop at this location will also be undertaken as part of the project.&nbsp; Saanich will work with a design team, including a Geotechnical Engineer to determine the best solution to stabilize the embankment.</p>
