      <p>Saanich has had an ongoing program of consultation with the broader community on the bicycle and pedestrian network which has been reflected in Local Area Plans and the Official Community Plan.&nbsp; Council recently set ambitious targets to increase the share of cycling trips from five percent to twelve percent in our Strategic Plan.&nbsp; Improving &ldquo;walkability&rdquo; has been one of the Municipalities highest priorities.&nbsp; Over the past few years, significant capital funds have been expended on the expansion of the bike, trail and sidewalk network.&nbsp; The Douglas Street Multiuse Connector came out of this work and is an important part of this network.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>In June of 2009 Saanich Engineering met with area residents to discuss possibilities for a section of the route which passes through Rainbow Park.&nbsp; Saanich Engineering wrote to the community in December 2009 to summarize the feedback gathered and to suggest some possible design modifications.&nbsp; A second meeting was held the summer of 2010 to ensure that we had a good understanding of the neighbourhood concerns and an undertaking was made to look for alternative routes.&nbsp; Those attending the meeting stated their support for cycling but felt that specific aspects of the proposed design were a problem.</p>
      <p>Two alternate routes were considered but not found to be viable.&nbsp; Locating the route on the west side of the berm would require a long retaining wall or the entire berm would have to be moved east into the park to provide clearance satisfactory to the Ministry of Transportation.&nbsp; Either approach was cost prohibitive.&nbsp; The option of using local streets around Rainbow Park was considered to be inconsistent with Council&rsquo;s stated policy of encouraging cycling and walking.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><strong>Design Status: </strong>Several specific concerns were raised at the two meetings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Loss of screening and noise attenuation due to a break in the berm</em> &ndash; The design has been modified so that the bike lane crosses the berm at the extreme northeast corner of the park through a saddle in the berm rather than a full depth cut.&nbsp; This break is screened from the park by a thick stand of trees.&nbsp; Additional trees could be planted there.</li>
        <li><em>Loss of privacy</em> &ndash; A privacy fence is proposed along the trail to prevent views into people&rsquo;s yards.</li>
        <li><em>User conflicts</em> &ndash; The path is proposed to be separated from the active use area of the park by a row of trees.&nbsp; The neighbourhood connection has been relocated around the edge of the active use area to minimize conflicts with park users.&nbsp; </li>
        <li><em>Concern about attracting criminal activity</em> &ndash; The project was discussed with Planning and Saanich Police.&nbsp; It has not been their experience that this kind of facility attracts undesirable behaviour.&nbsp; Saanich Police recommends designing in accordance with Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles.&nbsp; Generally, &nbsp;by providing good sight lines and increasing the number of people using the park, safety should be enhanced.&nbsp; </li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="pdf/RAINBOWDISPLAYBOARD.pdf">Proposed Design </a></p>
      <p><strong>Funding Status:</strong> In the summer of 2011 the Province of BC granted the District of Saanich a <em>Cycling Infrastructure Partnership Program (CIPP)</em> grant for the construction of the Douglas Connector mixed use trail link.&nbsp; This grant is for $100,000 with the condition that the Municipality match the contribution and that the funding be spent by June 30th of 2012.&nbsp; Saanich Council has approved the Saanich contribution as an early approval of the 2012 Capital Budget.&nbsp; The project will also be funded by a by a contribution to Saanich from the developer of the lots at 723, 727 and 731 Canterbury Road.&nbsp; This contribution was made at the time of development specifically for the construction of a mixed use trail between the above mentioned lots and the Pat Bay Highway off ramp.</p>
      <p><strong>Construction Schedule:</strong> As noted above the portion of funding supplied by the grant from the provincial government must be spent by June 30th of this year.&nbsp; Construction is planned to begin on Monday, April 30th and last approximately 5-6 weeks.&nbsp; We appreciate your co-operation in taking care around the construction equipment and activities. </p>
      <p>While we understand a project such as this will never receive complete acceptance, it is our view that the project supports the policies set by Council to reduce dependence on driving and increase healthy modes of travel.&nbsp;&nbsp; We look forward to the construction and completion of this important public amenity.&nbsp; Should you require further information regarding this project please contact me at <a href="mailto:jim.hemstock@saanich.ca">jim.hemstock@saanich.ca</a>.</p>
