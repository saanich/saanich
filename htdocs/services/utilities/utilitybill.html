      <h2><a name="charges"></a>Water and Sewer Charges on the Utility Bill </h2>
      <p> The District of Saanich meters all water consumed by customers
        with the exception of those residents in rural areas who
      are on wells.&nbsp; There are approximately 30,000 water meters in Saanich. &nbsp;Meters are read once every four months and utility accounts are billed once every four months. A typical Utility bill contains five separate lines of charges.&nbsp; (The first billing period of each year uses prorated water rates.)</p>
      <p>Line 1 &ndash; <strong>MONTHLY WATER CHARGE &ndash; </strong>this service charge varies depending on the size of your water meter.&nbsp; The standard meter size is currently 19mm (3/4 inch), although there are many meters in the ground that are 12.5mm (1/2 inch), which was the old standard size.</p>
      <table width="65%">

      <p>Line 2 &ndash; <strong>REGULAR WATER RATE </strong>&ndash; Water rates shown are based on cost per cubic metre.

      <p>Line 4 &ndash; <strong>SEWER USAGE RATE</strong> &ndash; this charge is the Saanich portion of the sewer charges.</p>
      <p>Sewer charges are based on consumption.&nbsp; Our sewer billing model looks at the current consumption and the consumption from the last two billing periods to determine the lowest consumption period, and then calculates the sewer charges based on that consumption.&nbsp; Of our three annual billing periods, the period that spans the late fall, winter, or early spring is typically the lowest consumption period.&nbsp; Our sewer model assumes that these consumptions are based on indoor usage which avoids summer watering consumption being included in sewer usage calculations. Sewer usage is calculated using rates which are based on per cubic metre

      <p><strong>Examples of Sewer Charge Calculation </strong><br>
      If the lowest consumption of the current and past two billing periods is 136m3 then the calculation would be as follows:<br>
      &nbsp; &#8226;&nbsp; 136m3 divided by 121 days (number of days in the lowest consumption billing period) = 1.12 m3 per day.<br>
      &nbsp; &#8226;&nbsp; 1.12 m3 X 121 days X $1.551 (total sewer rate) = $210.19 total sewer charges.<br>
      &nbsp; &#8226;&nbsp; Of the $210.19 total sewer charges, $112.89 of this is the Saanich Sewer Usage Rate, and $97.30 is the CRD Sewer Treatment Charge. <br>
         <br>
      Large residential customers (e.g. townhouses and condominiums) may be charged a surcharge, depending on the number of units relative to the size of the water meter.</p>
<p>A new utility account that requires a special meter reading is charged a $25.00 fee.&nbsp;<a href="#Moving"> See the Are You Moving? </a><a target="_blank"></a>section below for additional information.</p>

        Utility Bylaw</a><img src="/images/logos/pdf.gif" alt="PDF document" width="19" height="16"> for
        details regarding rates.</p>
      <p>Utility bills are payable upon receipt. &nbsp;A 5% penalty
        is added if unpaid after 30 days from the date of the bill.&nbsp; The
        provision of water is considered to be a service to the property
        and therefore any amount unpaid as at December 31 may be
        transferred as a charge on property taxes.</p>
