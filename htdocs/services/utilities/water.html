      <p>Probably no other municipal service is as vital to the health of its citizens as is a properly functioning potable water system. Saanich has 560 km of water pipe and five reservoirs. While we install and maintain the water distribution system, we purchase the water from the Capital Regional District. </p>
      <p>It is the homeowners' responsibility to maintain the water line from the meter to the house. </p>
      <p><strong>Annual Flushing<br />
      </strong>The Water Section of the Public Works Division of Saanich Engineering has an annual cleaning /flushing program that is advertised in local newspapers.&nbsp; This process may result in discolouration of your water for a short period of time.</p>
      <p> Specifications and standard drawings for the construction of sewers, drains, watermains, roads and sidewalks, are available from our Development Section for a charge of $25.00 plus HST (rate subject to change without notice).</p>
      <p><strong>Water Conservation<br />
      </strong>Your toilet is the largest consumer of water in your home, accounting for 40% of all water used. Showers and baths account for 35%, laundry and dishes 20% and cooking and drinking 5%. Here are some water conservation tips to help lower your water consumption around the home.</p>
