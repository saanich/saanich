      <h2>Sewers </h2>
      <p>The Municipality operates over 550 km of sewer mains. Of this total, nearly 350 km are asbestos cement mains installed between 1953 and the mid 1970's. Included in our sewer system are 5,240 manholes and 40 pumpstations.&nbsp; In the 1990's, a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system was installed.&nbsp; SCADA is a control monitoring device for our Sewer and Water Pumpstations. This system was recently updated to provide modern equipment, greater reliability, and the ability to record better and more detailed data. </p>
      <p>Not all of Saanich is included in the sewer system. Approximately one-third of our houses are outside the Sewer Enterprise Boundary. The Sewer Enterprise Boundary refers to a conceptual line defining the area approved by Council to be serviced by Municipal sewers. Every six months, the Engineering Department does a Sewer Enterprise Review and those houses that are in the Urban Containment Boundary may apply to be serviced by the existing sanitary system.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Our Drafting Section has service drawings and maps which show the sewer connections to the property line. </p>
      <p> The Urban Containment Boundary is the area which generally encompasses the sewered area of the Municipality and identifies the division between urban and rural land uses. If you live in rural Saanich, you are probably not on the sewer system. More information and/or applications should be directed to the <a href="mailto:clerksec@saanich.ca"> Office of the Municipal Clerk.</a></p>
      <p>Septic tanks and fields are not regulated by Saanich, they fall under the jurisdiction of the <a href="#crd"> Capital Regional District</a>.</p>
      <h2>Drains </h2>
      <p>The Municipal storm drainage system is composed primarily
        of many smaller systems, particularly in the rural areas
        of Saanich. The Municipal sewer (wastewater) system is separate
        from the drainage system (see above). </p>
      <p>Our Drafting Section
        has service drawings and maps which show drain connections
        to the property line, and we have a history of reported flooding
        from 1979 to 1994 available to the public.</p>
      <p><img src="/images/services/utilities/fish.gif" alt="image of fish" width="85" height="84" class="float-left" />If you have a drainage problem please contact the <a href="mailto:StormWasteWater@saanich.ca">Storm
        and Wastewater</a> section. If you wish to enclose a ditch,
        please contact the Engineering Department at 250-475-5575 (local 3458).</p>
      <p>Keeping
        our drainage system healthy is important because all our
        drainage water goes into our creeks and rivers. You will
        notice fish pictures beside some of our drain catch basins
        as a reminder.</p>

      <h2> Emergency Assistance
        Information - Flooding, Drainage and Sewer Backup </h2>
      <p>There are many causes of sewer or drainage damage. Most,
        but not all, damage results from a problem in the homeowner's
        private system, a problem in the Municipality's system, or
        damages to both systems from an outside source such as storms
        or vandalism. Through an investigation of the circumstances
        that surround the incident, the Municipality will attempt
        to identify the cause and the responsible party.</p>
      <h3>What Should I Do First?  </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Homeowners are responsible for determining where the blockage is located, regardless if it is on private or public property. A plumber should be called immediately.</li>
        <li>If the plumber clearly identifies the blockage is on the municipal side, immediately contact Saanich Storm and Wastewater, who will want the plumber to remain on site to provide further assistance as required.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What Should I Do Next? </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>It is the homeowners responsibility to take the first steps to minimize any further damage to personal property (i.e., remove undamaged items from the area).</li>
        <li>Call your insurance agent and advise of the damage as soon as possible and determine if your policy provides coverage.</li>
        <li>Arrange for cleanup through your own resources or those of your insurer to remove excess water or sewage as soon as possible. Sewage can create health hazards and you may require professional assistance. Damage restoration companies are listed in the telehone directory.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Protect Your Home From Flooding</h2>
      <p>It is important to protect your home from basement flooding
        because no matter where you live, your home is at risk for
        flooding. Why?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Heavy rainstorms that fall over short periods of time
          can overwhelm storms and sewer systems.</li>
        <li>Even if you or your neighbours have not experienced prior
          problems with flooding, your home can still be at risk.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Homeowners Guide to Flood Prevention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear eavestroughs, downspouts and catch basins of leaves
          and other debris that may prevent proper drainage.</li>
        <li>Have your drain system cleaned and repaired if necessary.</li>
        <li>If you are experiencing flooding, make sure to disconnect
          your downspouts approximately 1.2 metres (four feet) away
          from basement walls. Ensure that the water is not draining
          onto your neighbours' properties.</li>
        <li>Fix leaks in walls, floors, windows or foundations. Check
          for moisture along the walls and floor. Fill and seal
          any visible cracks.</li>
        <li>Ensure storm sewer grates (catch basin grates) both on
          or near your property aren&rsquo;t blocked by garbage,
          leaves, ice or other debris that would prevent proper
          drainage and potentially lead to flooding.</li>
        <li>The homeowner is responsible to determine where the blockage
          is located, regardless of whether it is on private or
          public property. You should call a plumber immediately.
          If your plumber clearly identifies the blockage is on the
          municipal side, immediately contact Saanich Storm and
          Wastewater (use link above), who will want the plumber to stay on site.</li>
        <li>The homeowner is responsible to take the first steps
          to minimize any damage to personal property, (i.e. &ndash; remove
          undamaged items from the area to prevent damages.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sand bags are available at the Saanich Municipal Yard, 1040
        McKenzie Avenue. These are for Residents only.</p>
      <p>In the case of an Emergency Flooding, please call 250-475-5597.</p>
