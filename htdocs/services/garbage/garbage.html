      <p>Every working day your
        garbage collectors pick up 7-10 tonnes
        of garbage per crew. You can help make that pickup
        safer and more efficient if you follow some general guidelines.</p>
      <p><strong>Frequency -- </strong>Pickup once every 2 weeks. </p>
      <p><strong>Please stay within limits.</strong> Household limit
        is 2 regulation cans per collection. Each garbage
        container should not exceed <strong>130 litres</strong> or weigh more
        than <strong>25 kg</strong> when full, and contents should flow out
        easily when dumped.</p>
      <p><strong>Bag loose material.</strong> To help prevent worker
        injury and litter blowing around, please bag loose
        material. Extra care should be taken with sawdust,
        kitty litter, and vacuum cleaner dust.</p>
      <p><strong>Wrap sharp objects.</strong> Please ensure all sharp objects are wrapped safely and that collectors are well aware of them. Broken glass and hypodermic needles must be in a puncture proof container.</p>
      <p><strong>Keep collection area clean. </strong>Please keep your
        collection area clean and accessible, and clear snow
        and ice if required. <strong>During snow and ice, if possible please assist collectors by placing cans at curb.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Keep the collection area accessible. </strong>Cans must be accessible between 7:00am and 8:00pm and be located at ground level with no gates or stairs required to access them. Cans must also be within 150m of a highway, and/or within 15m of an all weather driveway.</p>

      <p><strong>Special Pick Up Service</strong><br />

      <p><strong>Extra Cans and Stickers</strong><br />

      <strong>Litter Control Program<br />
      </strong>Solid Waste Services Litter Control Program operates year round. This program is responsible for the cleaning and the maintenance of 98 bus shelters, as well this program empties the municipality&rsquo;s 310 litter bins.
      <p>A large part of the program&rsquo;s responsibility is to clean up illegally dumped garbage. This takes the form of roadside clean up of litter, or the pick up of large amounts that are periodically dumped.</p>
      <p>If you see a bus shelter that is damaged or in need of cleaning, a litter bin, or an area that needs litter cleaned up, please call us at 250-475-5595.</p>

      <p>Stickers cost $3 per container, and can be purchased at the Saanich Municipal Hall, Saanich Public Works Yard or any of the Saanich Recreation Centres. </p>
