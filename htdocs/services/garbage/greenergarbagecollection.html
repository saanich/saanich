      <h3><strong>By providing a service that is easy and convenient, we can keep organics out of the landfill and make our community cleaner, greener and more sustainable.</strong></h3>
      <h2><strong>Greener Garbage Collection Starts Spring 2014</strong></h2>
      <p>The District of Saanich is pleased to introduce Greener Garbage Collection.</p>
      <p>Starting Spring 2014, Saanich residential garbage customers will be asked to divert kitchen scraps, food leftovers and food-soiled paper products from their household garbage for pick-up in a separate organics recycling cart. A great new feature of Greener Garbage Collection is that yard trimmings can be added to the organics recycling cart for collection too.</p>
      <p>To collect both garbage and organics recycling efficiently and control costs, Saanich will change to automated curbside collection where carts are emptied from the curb using a mechanical arm on a truck, instead of collectors going into backyards to retrieve, lift and empty cans by hand. Assistance programs will be available for those not able to place their carts curbside on collection day.</p>
      <h2><strong>Choose Your Carts</strong></h2>
      <p>In June 2013, customers will be asked to choose cart sizes that work best for their household. </p>
      <p>All Saanich garbage customers will receive a green standard sized 120-litre organics recycling cart and a grey standard sized garbage cart <strong>unless</strong> smaller, larger or additional carts are selected.</p>
      <p>Carts will be delivered to households in Spring 2014 and include a kitchen container for daily collection of kitchen scraps, a supply of compostable bags and information on curbside cart placement and recycling tips. </p>
      <h3><strong>Watch your mailbox for information about Greener Garbage Collection, choose your cart sizes and register for the assistance program now <a href="documents/GreenerGarbageCollectionSecondMailoutCartSelection.pdf"><img src="../../images/pdf.gif" alt="PDF" width="19" height="16" border="0"></a>. If you missed the July 5 deadline, and would like carts other than the standard sizes, please contact us and let us know.</strong></h3>
      <h2><strong>Cart Size Exchanges</strong></h2>
      <p>If the cart sizes you received are not to your satisfaction, they can be exchanged for different sizes for three months once the program starts. After the three months, a cart exchange administrative fee of $50 will be applied.</p>
      <h2><strong>Re-use and Recycle Your Old Cans</strong></h2>
      <p>Disinfect them and use them for storing emergency supplies or collecting rainwater for your garden. You can also bring them to the Public Works Yard for recycling. Information on recycling dates/times will be provided to households in 2014.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2><strong>Why Greener Garbage Collection? </strong></h2>
      <p><img src="images/clip_image001.jpg" alt="site pictures 152" width="209" height="139" class="float-left"> </p>
      <ul><li>Recycling kitchen scraps is the single most effective thing we can do for our environment. Kitchen scraps are the largest single item in our waste stream - making up more than 30% of what we throw away. </li>
        <li>To meet the region's waste diversion goals, the CRD will be phasing out organic waste at the landfill, with a <a href="http://www.crd.bc.ca/waste/organics/kitchen-scraps.htm">full ban on kitchen scraps</a> effective January 1, 2015. </li>
        <li>Recycling kitchen scraps reduces garbage and greenhouse gas emissions, extends the life of the Hartland landfill and turns a valuable resource into a useful product. </li>
        <li>Watch the Video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJQ6Err-E4&feature=youtu.be">Composting Kitchen Scraps in the Capital Region </a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Providing organics recycling is a big step towards making Saanich cleaner, greener and more sustainable and will substantially reduce the amount of garbage taken to the landfill. With the ban on kitchen scraps at the landfill coming into effect January 1, 2015, Saanich is providing more opportunities for customers to recycle, choose cart sizes that work best for their household and divert more than 8,000 tonnes of organics from the landfill every year. The organics recycling collected from more than 31,300 Saanich households will be recycled into nutrient-rich compost. </p>
      <h2><strong>Collection Service Costs </strong></h2>
      <p>Most households will see their collection costs remain about the same, depending on the cart sizes they choose. </p>
      <p>In 2013, Saanich garbage collection customers will pay $156 for solid waste services; this appears as a separate line item on property taxes. In 2014, this will be replaced with property owners paying an annual base fee of $105 for solid waste services plus an annual cart fee for their garbage and organics recycling carts.</p>
      <p>The carts are not being rented. The cart fees being charged cover the ongoing costs for disposal and processing of garbage and organics recycling collected in the carts at the Hartland landfill and compost facility.</p>
      <p>Additional carts will be available to single and multi-family households for an additional cart fee. Garbage and organics recycling will be collected on the same day, every second week. Saanich will maintain its current sticker and special pick-up programs. Cart sizes and fees are listed below. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2><strong>Kitchen Scraps Goes Beyond Composting</strong></h2>
      <p>Households that already backyard compost will be encouraged to continue to do so as it is the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly way to dispose of food waste. Kitchen scraps recycling <strong>complements </strong>backyard composting by accepting a wider range of food waste that may not be suitable for backyard composting such as cooked food, meat, bones, fish, baked goods, food-soiled paper and soiled food packaging. </p>
      <p>If you&rsquo;ve been using a garburator, now you can put your kitchen scraps to good use by placing them in your organics recycling cart instead. It&rsquo;s easy, creates compost and saves wear and tear on your pipes and plumbing too! </p>
      <p><img src="images/Septorgrecyclingincludes.png" width="690" height="472" alt="what goes in my organics recycling cart"></p>
      <h2><strong>Yard Trimmings Will Be Collected Too!</strong></h2>
      <p>Grass clippings, non-invasive prunings, plants and branches can be added to the organics recycling cart for collection every second week. This provides more opportunities for recycling, added convenience for households and enables further collection efficiencies. Curbside collection of yard trimmings will also reduce vehicle trips, congestion and waiting time at Saanich's Garden Recycling Drop-off. </p>
      <h2><strong>Moving Carts to the Curb on Collection Day is Made Easy </strong></h2>
      <p><img src="images/clip_image003.jpg" alt="Curbside Pickup" width="174" height="134" class="float-left"> </p>
      <p>The carts being provided are designed for easy mobility with large wheels under a stable base to accommodate manoeuvring in difficult weather, surface and grade conditions. </p>
      <p>Households will be asked to place their carts at the curb or in the mouth of driveways, oriented so the lids open toward the street on collection day and ensure they do not impede sidewalks, traffic and bicycle lanes. </p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
      <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
      <h2><strong>Assistance Programs will be Provided </strong></h2>
      <p>Assistance programs will be provided to residents with temporary or permanent mobility challenges who do not have someone to take their carts to the curb for them and if there is no able-bodied person over 18 years of age living in the residence. Solid Waste Services staff will assess each request and work directly with residents to ensure their needs are addressed and a satisfactory level of collection service is provided at no additional cost. </p>
      <p>If you require curbside assistance, please contact us and we will send you an application form to complete.</p>
      <h2><strong>Sustainable Saanich &ndash; Sustainable Solutions </strong></h2>
      <p>Saanich residents will divert an estimated 8,000 tonnes of compostable material from the landfill every year and reduced private vehicles trips to the Garden Recycling Drop-off and fleet replacement will eliminate an estimated 3,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas - significant steps in making our community cleaner, greener and more sustainable.</p>
      <h2><strong>Next Steps </strong></h2>

      <h2><strong>Kitchen Scraps Recycling Pilot Project </strong></h2>
      <p><img src="images/clip_image005.jpg" alt="kitchenscrapsrecycling" width="176" height="140" class="float-left"> </p>
      <p>In April 2012, Saanich carried out a three month <a href="kitchenscraps/index.html">Kitchen Scraps Recycling Pilot Project</a> to evaluate logistics related to the collection of kitchen scraps and provide opportunities for input from residents on kitchen scraps recycling and collection models. Information about the Kitchen Scraps Pilot Project are summarized in the pilot project report and participant survey results.</p>
