      <h1><strong> Greener Garbage Collection </strong><strong>for Curbside Garbage and Organics Recycling</strong></h1>
      <p>Starting spring 2014, households that receive garbage collection will start receiving organics recycling collection too. Recycling our organics &ndash; kitchen scraps and yard trimmings &ndash; will make our community cleaner, greener and more sustainable.</p>
      <p>To meet the CRD food waste ban, households will be asked to divert kitchen scraps from their garbage and place them in a separate organics recycling cart. Yard trimmings can also be added to the organics cart for collection every two weeks.</p>
      <p>To collect both household garbage and organics recycling efficiently, curbside collection will be introduced using automated collection vehicles to offset costs and maximize efficiencies.</p>
      <h2>What do I need to do now?</h2>
      <p>Watch your mailbox for  information about Greener Garbage Collection, cart size selection and assistance program registration in April 2013.</p>
      <h2>Why Greener Garbage Collection?</h2>
      <p align="justify"><img src="/living/about/news/2012/images/clip_image002_007.jpg" alt="site pictures 152" width="209" height="139" class="float-left">        <a href="http://www.iconarchive.com/show/silk-icons-by-famfamfam/tick-icon.html"><img src="/living/about/news/2012/images/clip_image001_005.png" alt="tick icon" width="16" height="16" class="float-left"></a>   Recycling kitchen scraps is the single most effective thing we can do for the environment. Kitchen scraps are the largest single item in our waste stream &ndash; making up more than &nbsp;  <span class="indent">30% of what we throw away.</span></p>
      <p align="justify"><a href="http://www.iconarchive.com/show/silk-icons-by-famfamfam/tick-icon.html"><img src="/living/about/news/2012/images/clip_image001_006.png" alt="tick icon" width="16" height="16" class="float-left"></a> Kitchen scraps will be banned from the Hartland landfill by January 1, 2015 <a href="http://www.crd.bc.ca/waste/organics/kitchen-scraps.htm">(CRD Regional Kitchen Scraps Diversion Strategy)</a>.</p>
      <p>        <a href="http://www.iconarchive.com/show/silk-icons-by-famfamfam/tick-icon.html"><img src="/living/about/news/2012/images/clip_image001_007.png" alt="tick icon" width="16" height="16" class="float-left"></a>   Recycling kitchen scraps  reduces  garbage and greenhouse gas emissions, extends the life of the Hartland landfill and turns a valuable resource into a useful product.</p>
      <p align="justify">        <a href="http://www.iconarchive.com/show/silk-icons-by-famfamfam/tick-icon.html"><img src="/living/about/news/2012/images/clip_image001_008.png" alt="tick icon" width="16" height="16" class="float-left"></a>   Collecting kitchen scraps and yard trimmings  provides more opportunities to recycle, added convenience for households and enables collection efficiencies.</p>
      <p align="justify"> <a href="http://www.iconarchive.com/show/silk-icons-by-famfamfam/tick-icon.html"><img src="/living/about/news/2012/images/clip_image001_009.png" alt="tick icon" width="16" height="16" class="float-left"></a>  Curbside collection will offset and stabilize future cost increases associated with the landfill kitchen scraps ban and collecting two separate waste streams.</p>
      <p align="justify">        <a href="http://www.iconarchive.com/show/silk-icons-by-famfamfam/tick-icon.html"><img src="/living/about/news/2012/images/clip_image001_010.png" alt="tick icon" width="16" height="16" class="float-left"></a>  Curbside collection is safer, quicker and easier. The standardized carts being provided for automated collection make handling easy and trucks can service more homes each day.</p>
      <h2>Collection Service Costs</h2>
      <p>  To encourage waste reduction, standard, smaller and larger carts compatible with automated collection will be provided. In June 2013, households will be asked to select garbage and organics recycling cart sizes that best meet their needs following a &ldquo;use less, pay less&rdquo; fee structure. </p>
      <p>Estimated user fees for biweekly collection will range from $155 to $215, depending on the cart sizes selected. Additional carts will be available to households at an additional user base fee + cart fee. Multi-family households will be provided with additional carts and containers in similar fashion. Saanich will maintain its current sticker and special pick-up programs.</p>
      <h2>Kitchen Scraps Recycling Goes Beyond Composting</h2>
      <p>Kitchen scraps include: </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.iconarchive.com/show/silk-icons-by-famfamfam/tick-icon.html"><img src="/living/about/news/2012/images/clip_image001_011.png" alt="tick icon" width="16" height="16" class="float-left"></a> </p>
      <p><strong>Food leftovers:</strong> including meat, fish, poultry, bones, dairy products, bread, solidified fats and grease, fruit and vegetables and plate scrapings.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.iconarchive.com/show/silk-icons-by-famfamfam/tick-icon.html"><img src="/living/about/news/2012/images/clip_image001_012.png" alt="tick icon" width="16" height="16" class="float-left"></a> </p>
      <p><strong>Soiled paper products:</strong> including paper towels and tissues, food packaging such as used paper cups and plates. </p>

      <p>        <img src="/living/about/news/2012/images/clip_image002_008.jpg" alt="Kitchenscrapsrecycling" width="174" height="143" class="float-left">  Households that already backyard compost will be encouraged to continue to do so as it is the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly way to dispose of food waste. Kitchen scraps recycling <strong>complements backyard composting</strong> by accepting a  wider range of food waste that may not be suitable for backyard composting such as cooked food, meat, bones, fish, baked goods, food soiled paper and food packaging.</p>
      <p>Households with garburators will be encouraged to use their organics recycling cart as it requires more water and energy to use a garburator than it takes to compost food waste. When leftovers go down the drain they increase the system&rsquo;s load which in turn increase operating costs and piping and treatment plants are simply not designed to take food waste.</p>
      <h2>Yard Trimmings Will Be Collected Too!</h2>
      <p>Grass clippings, prunings, plants and branches can  be added to the organics recycling cart for collection every second week. This provides more opportunities for recycling, added convenience for households and enables further collection efficiencies. Curbside collection of yard trimmings will also reduce vehicle trips, congestion and waiting time at the Public Works Yard Garden Recycling Drop-off.</p>
      <h2>Kitchen Scraps Containers, Organics Recycling and Garbage Carts Will Be Provided
</h2>
      <p><strong>      </strong>Households will be provided on a one-time basis with an indoor kitchen container for storing and transferring kitchen scraps to their larger organics recycling cart. A supply of compostable bags will be included to demonstrate which compostable bags can be used.</p>
      <p>In June 2013, households will be asked to select an 80L, 120L or 240L green cart for organics recycling (kitchen scraps and yard trimmings) and a 120L or 180L grey cart for household garbage. These wheeled carts are sturdy, include tight fitting lids and animal-proof latches and are designed to be easy to keep clean. The standardized carts being provided are compatible with automated and semi-automated collection vehicles.</p>
      <h2>Moving Carts to the Curb on Collection Day is Made Easy</h2>
      <p> <img src="/living/about/news/2012/images/clip_image002_009.jpg" alt="Curbside Pickup" width="174" height="134" class="float-left">  </p>
      <p>  Carts are designed for easy mobility with large wheels under a stable base to accommodate manoeuvring in difficult weather, surface and grade conditions. </p>
      <p>Households will be asked to place their carts at the curb or in the mouth of driveways, oriented so the lids open toward the street on collection day and ensure they do not impede traffic and bicycle lanes.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Curbside Collection Assistance Programs Will Be Provided</h2>
      <p>Assistance programs will be provided to residents with temporary or permanent mobility challenges who do not have someone to take their carts to the curb for them and there is no able-bodied person over 18 years of age living in the residence. Solid Waste Services staff will assess each request and work directly with residents to ensure their needs are addressed and a satisfactory level of collection service is provided at no additional cost. </p>
      <p>Residents will be able to apply for the assistance program in June 2013 as part of the cart size selection process.</p>
      <h2>Sustainable Saanich &ndash; Sustainable Solutions</h2>
      <p>  An estimated 3,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions will be eliminated through fleet replacement and reduced private vehicle trips to the Garden Recycling Drop-off, a significant step in helping Saanich achieve its sustainability goals.</p>
      <h2>What's Happening Now?</h2>
      <p><strong>      <img src="/living/about/news/2012/images/clip_image002_010.jpg" alt="Saanichcollectionvehicle" width="174" height="145" class="float-left">  </strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Saanich provides  backyard garbage collection service every second week to 31,655 households.</p>
      <p align="justify">In 2012 an estimated 13,000 tonnes of garbage will be collected and taken to the CRD Hartland landfill. </p>
      <p align="justify">35% of Saanich households voluntarily place their garbage curbside and the remainder receive full backyard collection service.</p>
      <p align="justify">To meet the region&rsquo;s diversion goal of 70% by 2015, the Capital Regional District approved a phased-in ban for kitchen scraps at the Hartland landfill (<a href="pdf/MediaReleaseCRD2012-04-11CRDKitchenScrapsStrategyMediaRelease.pdf">CRD Media Release</a>).</p>
      <p align="justify">In 2013 and 2014, Saanich will be eligible for CRD incentives of $80,000 each year for separated loads of kitchen scraps. If garbage loads are not source separated, in 2014 CRD surcharges of $358,000 will be assessed on Saanich garbage loads containing kitchen scraps. Effective January 1, 2015 kitchen scraps will be banned from the Hartland landfill.</p>
      <h2>Cost Containment</h2>
      <p>Results from the Kitchen Scraps Recycling Pilot Project show a high level of acceptance for kitchen scraps recycling and curbside collection and households want the service provided at no additional cost.</p>
      <p>Curbside collection of organics recycling and household garbage will provide efficiencies to offset future cost increases associated with the landfill kitchen scraps ban. </p>
      <p>To collect both organics recycling and household garbage, annual user fees for curbside collection service are estimated to be $155-$215, depending on cart sizes selected compared to $275-$300 if the existing model of backyard collection service was maintained. </p>
      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>A detailed implementation plan to transition from backyard collection to curbside collection of household garbage and organics recycling (kitchen scraps and yard trimmings) was approved by  Council on January 7, 2013.</p>
      <p>Changes to solid waste collection services will take 15-18 months to fully implement across the Municipality.</p>
      <h2>More Information</h2>
      <p>Every household will receive information about Greener Garbage Collection, including costs,  cart size selection and assistance program registration in April and June 2013. </p>
      <h2>Kitchen Scraps Recycling Pilot Project</h2>
      <p>In April 2012, Saanich carried out a three month Kitchen Scraps Recycling Pilot Project to evaluate logistics related to the collection of kitchen scraps and provide opportunities for input from residents on kitchen scraps recycling and collection models.
