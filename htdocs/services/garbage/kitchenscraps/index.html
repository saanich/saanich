      <h2>Pilot Project Results</h2>
      <p>In April 2012, Saanich carried out a three month Kitchen Scraps Recycling Pilot Project to evaluate logistics related to the collection of kitchen scraps and provide opportunities for input from residents on kitchen scraps recycling and collection models.</p>
      <p>Given the announcement by the CRD to ban kitchen scraps from the Hartland landfill as of January 1, 2015, pilot project results and feedback have been compiled and are being used to guide discussions about kitchen scraps recycling and collection in our municipality.&nbsp; The report and survey results can be viewed here:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Kitchen Scraps Recycling Pilot Project Report (<a href="pdf/KitchenScrapsRecyclingPilotProjectReport-September2012.pdf"><img src="../../../images/clip_image001_006.gif" alt="" width="19" height="16" border="0"></a> ) </li>
        <li>Kitchen Scraps Recycling PIlot Project Survey Results (<a href="pdf/KitchenScrapsRecyclingPilotProject-SurveyResults.pdf"><img src="../../../images/clip_image001_007.gif" alt="" width="19" height="16" border="0"></a> )</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To control future costs and meet the timelines for the CRD kitchen scraps ban at the Hartland landfill, on November 5, 2012 Council approved in principle the implementation of curbside collection service for kitchen scraps recycling and household garbage with an assistance program using standardized carts and municipal collection crews on or before January 1, 2015. In January 2013, Council approved a detailed implementation plan.</p>
      <p>Information about the implementation of curbside collection of garbage and organics recycling can be viewed at <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/greenergarbage">www.saanich.ca/greenergarbage</a>. </p>
      <h3>583 Households Recycled 19.42 Tonnes  of Kitchen Scraps </h3>
      <p>With  95% of  pilot project households participating, 19.42 tonnes of  kitchen scraps were diverted from the Hartland landfill and recycled.&nbsp; With a diversion rate of 37%, response to the pilot project was terrific!</p>

      <h3>Pilot Project Feedback</h3>
      <p>Comments received about the pilot project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>The kitchen scraps pilot is wonderful.&nbsp; I find it very easy to use once I remind myself what items are allowed.</em></li>
        <li><em>Thanks!&nbsp; I have been reluctant to put compostable items in the garbage.</em></li>
        <li><em>We love the kitchen scraps program very much.&nbsp; Thanks for a great job. </em></li>
        <li><em>We currently compost what kitchen waste we can in our backyard composters but a program such as yours would allow us to recycle meat, bones, etc.</em></li>
        <li><em>We are one of the test neighbourhoods for recycling kitchen waste.&nbsp; We are extremely happy with the result of reducing our non-recyclable garbage &ndash; and have found the entire process to be very easy. </em></li>
        <li><em>I am a Saanich resident residing outside the current kitchen scrap pilot area.&nbsp; I wanted to express my support for the program, and hope that it will be implemented in other areas as well.&nbsp; Composting is important to my family, so we have been using a paid composting service for the last several years to ensure our scraps escape the landfill.&nbsp; Thanks for getting the ball rolling in Saanich! </em></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Response to Collection Service</h3>
      <p>As part of the pilot project to assist with evaluating operational logistics, one area of 322 households received curbside service (carts picked up from and returned curbside) and a second area of 261 households received modified backyard service (carts picked up from the backyard and returned curbside). </p>
      <p>Thank you to pilot project participants who placed their carts curbside on collection days.&nbsp; This helped our collectors provide collection services efficiently.</p>

      <h3>CRD Votes to Implement Kitchen Scraps Strategy</h3>
      <p>In April 2012, the CRD Board approved a phased-in ban for kitchen scraps at the Hartland landfill.&nbsp; In 2013 and 2014 separated loads of kitchen scraps will be eligible for a $20 per tonne rebate.&nbsp; In 2014 there will be a 20% surcharge at the Hartland landfill on garbage loads containing kitchen scraps to discourage their disposal as garbage.&nbsp; Starting on January 1, 2015, the CRD will implement a ban on kitchen scraps from the Hartland landfill (<a href="http://www.crd.bc.ca/media/2012-04-11-kitchen-scraps-strategy.htm">CRD Media Release</a>).</p>
      <p>Currently 300 tonnes of garbage is collected from Saanich residents every week and taken to the Hartland landfill.&nbsp; It is estimated 30% of this garbage consists of kitchen waste which could be diverted through kitchen scraps recycling.</p>

      <h3>About the Kitchen Scraps Recycling Pilot Project</h3>
      <p>In April 2012, 583 households participated in a Kitchen Scraps Recycling Pilot Project to help  evaluate kitchen scraps recycling and collection models in our municipality.</p>
      <p> The three month pilot project took place  the Nicholson Street/Borden Street (<a href="pdf/map-nicolson-borden.pdf" target="_blank">Map 1</a> <img src="/images/pdf.gif" alt="" width="19" height="16" border="0">) and Livingstone Avenue N/Braefoot Road  (<a href="pdf/map-livingstone-braefoot.pdf" target="_blank">Map 2</a> <img src="/images/pdf.gif" alt="" width="19" height="16" border="0">) area.</p>
      <p>Kitchen scraps recycling containers, compostable bags and wheeled carts were provided to pilot project participants who were asked to place all of their kitchen scraps in a kitchen scraps recycling cart rather than their garbage cart.</p>
      <p>One area of 261 households received modified backyard service (carts picked up from the backyard and returned curbside) and a second area of 362 households received curbside service (carts picked up from and returned curbside).</p>
      <p>Kitchen scraps were collected at the same time as residential garbage for three months (six biweekly collections) starting May 2 and ending July 11, 2012.&nbsp; In addition to evaluating operational logistics on kitchen scraps recycling and collection, customer feedback formed an important part of the evaluation process.</p>
