      <p><strong>Why recycle kitchen scraps?</strong></p>
      <p>To extend the life of the Hartland landfill, the CRD has set a waste diversion goal of 70% by 2015.&nbsp; Organic materials, such as kitchen scraps and soiled paper products, constitute 30% of the waste stream going into the landfill. Kitchen scraps and soiled paper products can be recycled into useful products, such as compost.</p>
      <p>On April 11, 2012, the CRD Board approved a phased-in ban for kitchen scraps at the Hartland landfill.&nbsp; In 2013 and 2014 separated loads of kitchen scraps will be eligible for a $20 per tonne rebate.&nbsp; In 2014 there will be a 20% surcharge at the Hartland landfill on garbage loads containing kitchen scraps to discourage their disposal as garbage.&nbsp; Starting on January 1, 2015, the CRD will implement a ban on kitchen scraps from the Hartland landfill.</p>
      <p><strong>What are kitchen scraps?</strong></p>
      <p>Kitchen scraps consist of food waste ranging from fruit and vegetable scraps to meat, bones and tea bags and compostable paper products such as paper towels and tissues.</p>
      <p><strong>Will kitchen scraps recycling make a difference?</strong><br>
        300 tonnes of garbage is collected from Saanich residents every week and taken to the Hartland landfill. It is estimated 30% of this garbage could be diverted through kitchen scraps recycling.</p>
      <p><strong>What are the benefits?</strong><br>
        Recycling kitchen scraps has many benefits, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reducing your garbage</li>
        <li>Extending the life of the Hartland landfill</li>
        <li>Saving a valuable resource</li>
        <li>Producing useful products such as compost</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Pilot Project</h2>
      <p><strong>Why are we conducting a pilot project?</strong><br>
        In anticipation of the CRD introducing incentives and surcharges on kitchen scraps at the Hartland landfill in 2013 and 2014 and a complete ban on kitchen scraps from the Hartland landfill in 2015,  Solid Waste Services will have operational experience and feedback from residents about kitchen scraps recycling and modified backyard and curbside collection models to use as a basis for future kitchen scraps recycling discussions.</p>
      <p><strong>What is modified backyard and curbside collection?</strong></p>
      <p>One pilot project area of 261 households will receive modified backyard service (carts picked up from the backyard and returned curbside) and a second area of 322 households will receive curbside service (carts picked up from and returned curbside).&nbsp; Currently, an estimated 35% of Saanich residents voluntarily place their cans curbside and the remainder receive full backyard collection service.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><strong>Where is the pilot project taking place?</strong></p>
      <p>Modified backyard kitchen scraps recycling collection is taking place in the Nicholson Street/Borden Street area (<a href="pdf/map-nicolson-borden.pdf" target="_blank">Map 1</a> <img src="/images/pdf.gif" alt="" width="19" height="16" border="0">). Curbside kitchen scraps recycling collection is taking place in the Livingstone Ave N/Braefoot Road area (<a href="pdf/map-livingstone-braefoot.pdf" target="_blank">Map 2</a> <img src="/images/pdf.gif" alt="" width="19" height="16" border="0">).</p>
      <p><strong>How long will the pilot project last?</strong><br>
        The pilot project will last three months and include six biweekly collections starting May 2 and ending July 11, 2012.</p>
      <p><strong>How will the pilot project be evaluated?</strong><br>
        In addition to operational logistics, customer feedback on kitchen scraps recycling and collection models will form an important part of the evaluation process.</p>
      <p><strong>What will happen after the pilot project?</strong><br>
        Solid Waste Services will review the results of the pilot project and prepare a report for the District's Finance and Personnel Committee.&nbsp; Council and staff will use information from the pilot project and resident feedback to guide future discussions on kitchen scraps recycling and collection. </p>
      <p><strong>What is the cost of the pilot project?</strong><br>
        Carts and containers for the project cost $49,000; the carts will be collected from participants and stored or sold after the pilot project is complete.</p>
      <p><strong>How much does household garbage collection cost?</strong><br>
        In 2012 Saanich households pay $149.60 for garbage collection which includes backyard garbage pickup, recycling pickup, compost drop-off and leaf removal programs.</p>
      <h2>Kitchen Scraps Recycling</h2>
      <p><strong>What can I put in my kitchen scraps recycling cart?</strong><br>
        All food (cooked and raw) and compostable paper products can be recycled.&nbsp; Please refer to the <a href="accepted.html">List of Accepted/Not Accepted Items for Kitchen Scraps Recycling</a> for more information. </p>
      <p><strong>What type of soiled paper can I add to my kitchen scraps?</strong><br>
        Soiled paper can be added to kitchen scraps recycling as long as it contains no plastic such as napkins, tissues, waxed paper, cardboard and muffin liners. Plastic coated paper (like coffee cups and meat liners) cannot be added. If you are not sure what you have, try tearing the paper &ndash; plastic coated paper will stretch.&nbsp; Remember, if your paper is clean, recycle it in your blue box. </p>
      <p><strong>What happens to the kitchen scraps that are collected?</strong><br>
        Kitchen scraps are a valuable resource. Although the kitchen waste generated in your home may not be suitable for backyard composting, it can be processed in a controlled composting facility. </p>
      <p>Kitchen scraps collected are taken to the International Composting Corporation facility in Nanaimo for processing into soil fertilizer.&nbsp; The finished product is sold as a topsoil amendment and Class &lsquo;A&rsquo; compost. It is used by home gardeners, landscapers and farmers to regenerate poor soils, improve plant growth and increase nutrients in the soil.</p>
      <p><strong>Can I still use my backyard composter?</strong><br>
        Yes.&nbsp; Please continue to use your home composter as it is the most cost effective and environmentally friendly way to dispose of food waste. Use the kitchen scraps recycling pilot project for &ldquo;other&rdquo; organic materials such as meat, bones, fish and bread.</p>
      <p><strong>I have a garburator: Can I use this for my food scraps?</strong><br>
        It requires more water and energy to use a garburator than it takes to compost food waste. When leftovers go down the drain they increase the system&rsquo;s load which in turn increase operating costs. Piping and treatment plants are simply not designed to take food waste. Also, fats and oils in food cause deposits and clogging in your home&rsquo;s pipes and in your local sewer system.</p>
      <p><strong>Do other municipalities recycle kitchen scraps?</strong><br>
        As resources and landfill space become more scarce and efforts for sustainability more prominent, many jurisdictions are moving towards curbside kitchen scraps collection, treating organic materials as a valuable resource instead of &ldquo;waste&rdquo;. </p>
      <p>Kitchen scraps recycling programs are provided to all residents in the Town of View Royal and provided on a pilot basis to some residents in the District of Oak Bay. It is estimated these residents divert over 450 tonnes of kitchen scraps from their garbage each year. </p>
      <p>The City of Victoria is planning to provide kitchen scraps recycling to all residents in 2013. On Vancouver Island, Ladysmith and Nanaimo collect kitchen scraps and North Cowichan plans to start collecting kitchen scraps in June.</p>
      <h2>Kitchen Scraps Recycling and Garbage Collection</h2>
      <p><strong>When are kitchen scraps and garbage being collected?</strong><br>
        Kitchen scraps are being collected at the same time as biweekly garbage collection starting on Wednesday, May 2 for three months (six biweekly collections) starting on May 2 and ending July 11.</p>
      <p><strong>Why are we providing wheeled carts to pilot project participants?</strong></p>
      <p>Standardized wheeled carts are easy to move and allow collectors to use truck lifters to empty carts quickly and easily.</p>
      <p><strong>Why are we picking up from and/or leaving carts curbside?</strong></p>
      <p>Collecting from the curb and/or leaving carts at the curb for return to backyards will allow Solid Waste Services to evaluate operational logistics for both collection models.</p>
      <p><strong>Can I still have backyard service or receive assistance moving my carts?</strong></p>
      <p>Staff will continue to provide backyard service and provide assistance to those who do not have an abled bodied person residing at the residence.</p>
      <p><strong>If I am in the curbside collection area, where do I place the carts?</strong></p>
      <p>Place your carts within 5 feet of the traveled portion of the roadway, taking care to ensure they do not impede vehicle, bicycle or pedestrian traffic.</p>
      <p><strong>Can I continue to use my existing garbage can(s)?</strong><br>
        No. It is hoped that the standardized wheeled carts are easy for participants to use and allow collectors to use truck lifters to empty carts quickly and easily. </p>
      <p><strong>What do I do with my existing garbage can(s)?</strong><br>
        Please keep your existing garbage cans as the carts provided  will be collected at the end of the three month pilot project.</p>
      <p><strong>If I move, do I take the carts with me?</strong></p>
      <p>No.&nbsp; Please leave the carts with the residential address in the pilot project area.</p>
      <p><strong>What happens if my carts get damaged?</strong></p>
      <p>Please contact Solid Waste Services staff at (250) 475-5595 or send an <a href="mailto:greenergarbage@saanich.ca">email</a>  should your carts need to be replaced.</p>
