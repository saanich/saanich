      <h3 align="left"><strong>To collect garbage and organics recycling efficiently and control costs, we are moving to automated curbside collection, where standardized collection carts are emptied from the curb using a mechanical arm on a truck, instead of collectors going into backyards to retrieve, lift and empty cans by hand.</strong></h3>
      <h3 align="left"><strong>The carts provided to households for automated collection will make handling easy for everyone and trucks can service more homes each day.</strong></h3>
      <h2><strong>Moving Carts Curbside is Made Easier</strong></h2>
      <p align="left">        Every household will be supplied with wheeled carts that are compatible with automated collection and asked to place their carts at the curb or in the mouth of their driveway on collection day. The carts being provided are designed for easy mobility with large wheels under a stable base to accommodate manoeuvring in difficult weather, surface and grade conditions.</p>
      <h2><strong>Curbside Collection Assistance Will Be Provided</strong></h2>
      <p>        Curbside collection assistance programs will be provided to residents with temporary or permanent mobility challenges who do not have someone to take their carts to the curb for them and if there is no able-bodied person over 18 years of age living in the residence. </p>
      <p align="left">Collectors will pick up garbage and organics recycling carts from the outside of the front or back door of the home. There is no additional charge for this service. </p>
      <p align="left">Staff will work directly with residents to ensure their needs are addressed and a satisfactory level of collection service is provided.</p>
