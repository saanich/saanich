      <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Content" --> Saanich encourages and supports the use of bikes on all Municipal roads, and has adopted a
				    	Commuter Bicycle Network to identify streets which will eventually be modified to accommodate
				    	cycling. Saanich also has a Bicycle Advisory Committee, made up of interested citizens, the <a href="http://www.gvcc.bc.ca" target="_blank">Greater Victoria Cycling Coalition</a>, and
					    	Municipal staff from Engineering, Public Works,	Planning and Police. A copy of the overall <a href="pdf/BikewayNetworkOverallWebOctober2010.pdf" target="_blank">Bikeway Network Map</a> is available here.

                            <h2>Local Connector Routes                            </h2>
                            <p> A local connector route signifies a bicycle route within a neighbourhood for local residents
                              that links major neighbourhood amenities such as parks, schools and other institutions and
                              services, or links to regional trails or other external destinations. These routes are
                              intended for the recreational or inexperienced cyclists, and also cyclists who seek a quieter
                              route which avoids major roads.</p>
                            <p> Local connectors are often indirect routes and are located on low traffic volume streets.
                              Generally, there are no road improvements associated with the designation of a local
                              connector route.</p>
                            <p> Local connectors are designated in the Local Area Plans when identified and approved by Council. The local connectors are
                              indicated with yellow signs as shown on the right. The symbols are located on sign posts along
                              the local connector route. Arrows denote the route direction, especially at intersections
                              where it will indicate if the route continues straight or turns.</p>
                            <h2>Commuter Routes</h2>
                            <p> Saanich has designated a number of commuter bicycle routes which provide for direct access
                              within and through the municipality to link major employment destinations. They have higher
                              volumes of vehicle traffic and are intended for the experienced cyclist.</p>
                            <h2>Bicycle Touring Route</h2>
                            <p> The <a href="pdf/biketouristmap.pdf" target="_blank">Saanich Bicycle Touring Route</a> <img src="../../images/logos/pdf.gif" alt="PDF"> circumnavigates the Municipality of Saanich. Wherever
                              possible, it follows the Galloping Goose or Lochside Regional Trails; elsewhere it uses rural
                              or residential roads. The eastern section offers spectacular ocean views; the northern section
                              passes Elk and Prospect Lakes, both with excellent swimming and picnic facilities; to the west
                              are rural undeveloped forested areas and farms; the southern section follows the Galloping
                              Goose Regional Trail overlooking the Portage Inlet.</p>
                            <p> The total circle route is approximately 45 km, but cyclists preferring a shorter route may
                              follow a smaller loop by taking any of the many other bicycle routes within Saanich. Bicycle
                              symbols on a bright yellow back-ground clearly mark the route direction as it passes through
                              Saanich.</p>
                            <h2>Galloping Goose Regional Trail</h2>
                            <p> The <a href="http://www.crd.bc.ca/parks/galloping_goose.htm" target="_blank">Galloping Goose
                              Regional Trail</a> is an off-road multi-use trail system along an abandoned rail right of way.
                              The trail serves a variety of users from all age groups, including walkers, cyclists, and
                              roller bladers and accommodates strollers and wheel chairs.</p>
                            <p> The <a href="http://www.crd.bc.ca/parks/lochside.htm" target="_blank">Lochside Regional
                              Trail</a> begins at the Switch bridge and travels north to Sidney and the Swartz Bay Ferry
                              Terminal.</p>
                            <p> In 1999 Saanich constructed a bridge crossing over Blenkinsop Lake. The bridge design
                              incorporates features to protect the valued environmental and ecological features of the lake.</p>
