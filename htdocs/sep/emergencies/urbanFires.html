      <p><img src="../image/urbanfireforwebpage.jpg" alt="House Fire" class="float-right"> Fire Safety is an important issue for all of us. Residential fires are responsible
        for a tragic number of deaths, injuries and millions of dollars in property damage
        and health care costs annually. Most people will never face a major fire but don't
        think it will never happen to you! </p>
      <p> A smouldering fire may go undetected for hours, especially when people are asleep.
        Such a fire will continue developing, giving off smoke and gases which may not be
        visible but which consume oxygen and replace it with toxic gases, such as carbon
        monoxide, sulphur dioxide and hydrogen cyanide. </p>
      <p> These killer agents can take effect before a sleeper is disturbed. An early
        warning system -- <a href="http://saanich.ca/resident/safety/fire/smokealarm.html">a
          smoke alarm</a> -- is considered one of the most effective defences against this
        situation. </p>
      <p> <strong>Smoke Alarms</strong>
      <ul>
        <li> Purchase one or more <a href="http://saanich.ca/resident/safety/fire/smokealarm.html">smoke
          alarms.</a> </li>
        <li>Install alarms properly.</li>
        <li>Identify escape routes and practice escaping.</li>
        <li>Maintain your alarms.      </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <strong>How do smoke alarms work?</strong> </p>
      <p> Smoke alarms work by sensing the rising smoke from a fire and sounding an alarm.
        They can detect smoke far from the origin of the fire. Smoke alarms are most
        valuable at night, alerting family members to the presence of fire when they are
        asleep. Smoke alarms can alert the occupants in the early stages of a fire while
        conditions are such that a safe evacuation is still possible. </p>
      <p> <strong>Maintain your smoke alarm</strong> </p>
      <p> Smoke alarms should be cleaned at least once every six months. They are to be
        tested at least once a year, and battery powered alarms are to have new batteries
        installed at least once a year. It is recommended that smoke alarms older than 10
        years be replaced. </p>
      <p> <strong>Practice your escape</strong> </p>
      <p> Now that you have your first line of defence, your family should <a href="http://saanich.ca/resident/safety/prep/escape.html">have an escape
        plan</a>, because getting out may not be as easy as walking out the door. Plan and
        practice exit drills with at least two ways out from every room of your home.
        Make the escape drills as realistic as possible - pretend that certain exits are
        blocked, that there are no lights and that hallways are filling with smoke. Teach
        everyone to recognize the sound of the smoke alarm and what to do when they hear
        it. Never return to a burning building under any circumstance, and use a
        neighbour's phone for the emergency call to 9-1-1. Here are some key things to
        remember:
        
      <ul>
        <li>If you encounter smoke, use your alternate exit.</li>
        <li> If you must escape through smoke, crawl low where the air is cooler and
          cleaner. </li>
        <li> If your clothing catches on fire - DO NOT RUN - instead STOP, DROP to the
          ground and ROLL to smother the flames.      </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <strong>General Safety Tips</strong>
                                  <ul>
                                    <li> If electrical systems and equipment are not well-maintained, they become
                                      fire hazards. Follow these safety tips to prevent electrical fires: </li>
                                    <li> Immediately replace any electrical cords that are cracked or frayed or
                                      that get hot during use. </li>
                                    <li>Don't overload electrical outlets or extension cords.</li>
                                    <li> If appliances aren't working right, have them repaired by a qualified
                                      professional. </li>
                                    <li> Disconnect any electrical device if you feel a tingle when you touch it,
                                      if it emits a burning smell, or if it blows a fuse. </li>
                                    <li>Be sure all your electrical appliances are ULC labelled.</li>
                                    <li> If a fuse blows or a circuit breaker trips in your home, try to find out
                                      why. Make sure the new fuse is the right size and amperage. Fuses and
                                      circuit breakers protect you; don't tamper with them. </li>
                                    <li> If there are small children in your home, insert plastic child protector
                                      covers into electrical outlets. </li>
                                    <li> Prevent shocks. Make sure your hands are dry and do not stand in or near
                                      water when using appliances such as hair dryers. Unplug them after use.
                                      If the inside of an appliance gets wet, have it serviced before using it
                                      again.      </li>
                                  </ul>
      <p> <strong>Kitchen</strong>
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>Never leave cooking unattended.</li>
                                    <li>Keep your stove and oven clean.</li>
                                    <li>Wear close-fitting sleeves when cooking.</li>
                                    <li>Do not hang curtains or store things over the stove.</li>
                                    <li> Turn pot handles inward so they can't be knocked off the stove or pulled
                                      down by small children. </li>
                                    <li> If a grease fire starts, carefully slide a lid over the pan to smother
                                      the flames, and turn off the burner. Never pour water on a grease fire. </li>
                                    <li>Never leave pot holders on the stove.                                  </li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <p> <strong>Sleeping Areas</strong>
      <p> The majority of fatal home fires happen while people are sleeping. So it is
                                    extremely important to install smoke alarms and to practice <a href="http://saanich.ca/resident/safety/prep/escape.html">family escape
                                      drills</a>. </p>
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>Never smoke in bed.</li>
                                    <li> Install smoke alarms on every level of your home (including the basement)
                                      and especially outside every sleeping area. Make sure everyone can hear
                                      and recognize the alarm's sound. If you sleep with bedroom doors closed,
                                      install alarms inside bedrooms, as well. </li>
                                    <li> <a href="http://saanich.ca/resident/safety/prep/escape.html">Plan and
                                      practice two escape routes</a> from each room. If one way out leads
                                      through a window above the first floor, make sure you have a way to reach
                                      the ground safely. </li>
                                    <li> Make sure everyone in your family knows the home escape plan, the meeting
                                      place, and the phone number of the fire department (9-1-1), which they
                                      should call from a neighbour's phone, after escaping from the building.      </li>
                                  </ul>
      <p> <strong>Basement or Garage</strong>
                                  <ul>
                                    <li> If you keep gasoline on hand, store it outside your home or in a detached
                                      garage. Keep only small quantities, and use a ULC-listed gasoline safety
                                      can. </li>
                                    <li> Always store paint and other flammable liquids in their original labelled
                                      containers with tight-fitting lids. </li>
                                    <li> Use and store flammable liquids well away from appliances, heaters, pilot
                                      lights, cigarettes, and other sources of heat. </li>
                                    <li>Have your furnace checked every year by a professional.</li>
                                    <li> Remove trash from your home. Don't store anything near the furnace or
                                      heater. </li>
                                    <li> Never use gasoline to start a barbeque or campfire. Keep barbeques outside
                                      of homes, and away from overhangs and combustibles. </li>
                                    <li> Before starting your lawnmower, snowblower or motorcycle, move it away
                                      from gasoline fumes. Let the motor cool before you refuel.      </li>
                                  </ul>
      <p> <strong>Living & Family Rooms</strong>
                                  <ul>
                                    <li> Use extreme caution with cigarettes! Provide large, deep ashtrays for
                                      smokers. Check for smouldering cigarettes under cushions of couches and
                                      chairs before you go to bed or leave your home. </li>
                                    <li> Keep portable space heaters at least 1 metre (3 feet) away from anything
                                      that can burn. Always turn heaters off when you go to bed or go out. Never
                                      leave children alone in a room with a portable heater or woodstove
                                      operating. </li>
                                    <li>Use a metal screen on your fireplace.</li>
                                    <li> Have your chimney professionally checked once a year and cleaned when
                                      necessary. </li>
                                    <li> Use only the correct fuel for heat: aged wood in fireplaces and woodstoves
                                      and only kerosene in kerosene heaters. Refuel a heater in a
                                      well-ventilated area, after the heater has cooled. </li>
                                    <li> Keep lighters and matches up high, preferably in a locked cabinet, where
                                      young children can't see or reach them. </li>
                                    <li> Make sure TVs and stereos have space around them to prevent overheating.                                  </li>
                                  </ul>
