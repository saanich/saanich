      <p><img src="../image/earthquake.jpg" class="float-right" alt="Courtenay/Comox area, 1946"> Earthquakes are common in B.C. and more than 1,200 are recorded each year. Most
          are too small to be felt, but an earthquake capable of causing structural damage
          is expected to occur about once every ten years. </p>
        <p> Each year, seismologists with the <a href="http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/index_e.php" target="_blank">Geological Survey of
          Canada</a> record and locate more than 1,000 earthquakes in western Canada. That
          is 2 or 3 earthquakes a day	and most of these we never feel. </p>
        <p> The earth's crust is made up of plates which are like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle which
          are constantly moving, relative to one another, at speeds of about 2-10 cm/year or about
          as fast as your fingernails grow. </p>
        <p> The plates can either slide past one another, collide, or they can move apart.
          Want to see how this works? Check out this BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_4130000/newsid_4132300/4132319.stm" target="_blank"> animated earthquake guide</a>. </p>
        <p> The west coast of Canada is one of the few areas in the world where all three of
          these types of plate movements take place, resulting in significant earthquake
          activity. Saanich could experience an earthquake that causes damage and
          injury. </p>
        <p> It is important to know how to protect yourself in an earthquake, establish a
          plan and stock emergency supplies. The best way to learn is to take one of the <strong>free</strong> emergency preparedness workshops offered year around through the Saanich Emergency Program. Check out the calendar on this site or call (250) 475-7140 for upcoming workshops.</p>
        <p> <img src="../image/earthquake2.jpg" alt="Courtenay/Comox area, 1946" class="float-right"> There are a number of websites offering useful and detailed information about
          earthquakes and earthquake preparedness: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> The <a href="http://www.pep.bc.ca/hazard_preparedness/Earthquake_Information.html"
											 target="_blank"> Provincial Emergency Program</a> has detailed information
            on earthquake preparedness. </li>
          <li> The <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/exec/nisqually/" target="_blank"> Nisqually earthquake</a> in the Seattle area in 2001 was a significant
            earthquake event. </li>
          <li> The <a href="http://earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/info-gen/faq-eng.php"
											 target="_blank"> Natural Resources Canada</a> website has answers to many
            frequently asked questions about earthquakes </li>
          <li> The <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/" target="_blank"> US Geological
            Survey</a> has information about earthquakes which have occurred in the last
            7 days, around the world. </li>

        <h2>Sidney B.C. Pacific Geoscience Centre</h2>
        <p> Scientists at PGSC Sidney are engaged in geoscientific research aimed at
          increasing our understanding of the geological history, processes, and hazards
          affecting Western Canada. They provide useful information about their many
          research efforts, as well as help with understanding of the many aspects of
          geoscience that influence our everyday lives. </p>
