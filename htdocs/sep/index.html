		    <p><strong>The District of Saanich Is Listening</strong></p>
		    <p>Involving the public in discussions on matters that affect them is a long standing practice at the District of Saanich. The inclusion of diverse opinions, information and experiences has improved the quality of decisions made. </p>
		    <p>As public participation practices, citizen interest and technology evolve, it is important that we &ldquo;check in&rdquo; with residents and stakeholders to determine if there are improvements that we can make in our participation practices. </p>
		    <p>One of the initiatives identified in the 2012 &ndash; 2016 Strategic Plan was to develop a public participation policy and facilitate public participation training for staff. We need your feedback and invite you to complete a survey and offer your ideas on the principles and practices that the District should consider when planning public participation opportunities. Your feedback will be used to guide the development of a public participation policy and framework that will ensure a consistent organizational approach to public participation initiatives. </p>
