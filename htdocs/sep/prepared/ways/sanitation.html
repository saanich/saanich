      <h2>Handwashing</h2>
      <p> After any disaster, stress will be high and immunity low. Children, the elderly
        and people with chronic health problems or weakened immune systems will be more
        vulnerable to - and seriously affected by - communicable diseases. </p>
      <p> Health officials stress that <strong>handwashing is the single most important
        practice</strong> that can protect you and your family members from getting a
        communicable disease. </p>
      <p> Diseases like the cold virus, and influenza can also spread through the air via
        respiratory droplets. </p>
      <p> There must always be some method of handwashing available to people after they
        use whatever toilet system is in place and before handling, preparing or eating
        food, especially in a situation where water is limited. </p>
      <p> Yet few people know how to properly wash their hands. </p>
      <p> You don't need much water - one cup per handwashing.  Use liquid soap and dry
        hands with disposable paper towels, not cloth. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>pour &frac14; cup of water on your hands to wet them</li>
        <li>apply plain <strong>liquid</strong> soap</li>
        <li> rub your hands together vigorously, palm to palm, interlaced fingers, back of
          each hand with palm of other hand </li>
        <ul>
          <li>your hands should be washed for a minimum of 20 seconds</li>
        </ul>
        <li>pour the remaining &frac34; cup of water over your hands to rinse</li>
        <li>dry hands thoroughly with a paper towel</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Human Waste</h2>
      <p>After a major disaster like an earthquake, water and sewer lines may be broken.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Health officials advise us to <strong>separate</strong> solid waste from liquid waste.</li>
        <li> Urine is not considered a serious health problem. If you use one bucket for
          urine, you can dispose of it in your back yard or other green space.</li>
        <li> Feces, on the other hand, is a source of many disease causing bacteria,
          including cryptosporidia and cholera.</li>
        <ul>
          <li> It <strong>must</strong> be disposed of more carefully to prevent outbreak of disease.</li>
        </ul>
        <li> You can use your existing toilet as container to collect feces in.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Lift the toilet seat</li>
          <li>scoop out the water in the bowl,</li>
          <li>line the toilet bowl with a double garbage bag (to protect against leakage)</li>
          <li>put the seat back down.</li>
          <li>After you use the toilet, cover the feces in the bag with a liberal dose of hydrated lime.</li>
          <li>The hydrated lime serves a number of purposes.</li>
          <li>It contols odour, bacteria and flies which can spread disease.</li>
          <li> It also helps to dry out the waste in the bag so that when it is time to
            dispose of this waste, it will be easier to handle. </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p> <strong>Listen to Public Health bulletins for instructions on how the bags should
        ultimately be disposed of.</strong> </p>
