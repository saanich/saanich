        <h2>Good Neighbours </h2>
        <p><img src="../../images/discover/arts/events/hbc_tall.png" alt="Painting" width="130" height="300" align="right">The importance of historic houses and neighbourhoods to our communities is a theme that many people can relate to. While ornate historic houses are what many people think of first when they hear &ldquo;heritage&rdquo;, established, stable and attractive neighbourhoods make an equally important contribution to the community, creating a positive sense of well being, enjoyment, and security.</p>
      <p>The theme explores the character and warmth of historic homes, and the timeless appeal of established, older neighbourhoods with vintage house styles, gardens, landscaping, trees and boulevards. Often close to the town centre and developed in an era when the automobile was a less dominant feature of daily life, older neighbourhoods lend themselves to a more sustainable lifestyle. Neighbourhoods and districts from earlier eras also promote a layered sense of community history and contribute to visual appeal and variety. They enhance community attractiveness and livability.</p>
        <p>Confirmation of the broad appeal of these qualities is reflected in the desirability of heritage homeownership, the premium prices generally paid, and the fact that heritage homes hold their value better than other segments of the residential market. The value of the individual heritage home is significantly affected by its context of other well preserved vintage homes &ndash; the market value lies as much with the character of the neighbourhood as with the house itself. There is also the role of heritage homeowners who through their pride of ownership, stewardship, and investment, give a lot to the community.</p>

      <h3>Earthquake Home Retrofit Class</h3>
      <p><strong>Fairfield Community Place&nbsp;<br>
  1330 Fairfield Rd</strong><br>
  Date:&nbsp;Monday, January 28, 2013<br>
  Time:&nbsp;7:00 to 9:00 pm<br>
      <strong>Free</strong></p>
      <p> In Victoria's four core municipalities there are over 27,000 homes constructed before the simplest earthquake resistance standards were implemented.&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction prior to 1980 lacked the basic attachment hardware which helps keep the building on its foundation during an earth quake. Modern techniques have been developed to allow homeowners to retrofit their homes and improve earthquake resistance. These simple steps could help you keep your home
      on its foundation and you in your home.</p>
