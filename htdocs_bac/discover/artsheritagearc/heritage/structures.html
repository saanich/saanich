      <p>The following are a few of the more familiar heritage structures in Saanich:</p>
      <h2>770 Vernon Avenue:
        Municipal Hall</h2>
      <p> Following the Second World War, the old Saanich Municipal Hall was unable to
        accommodate the growth of municipal administration. In 1947 Hubert Savage was
        commissioned to design an addition and alterations to the old hall. In 1957 an
        additional 9,000 square feet of space was again required. A Municipal Hall Reserve
        Fund By-law was passed in 1959 which set aside funds for a future new hall. It was
        decided that a more central location for the hall would be better. In 1961-62 the
        new Police-Fire Hall building was constructed on Vernon Avenue. The following year,
        the Health and Welfare building was built on an adjacent site on Vernon, to designs
        by architect Clive Campbell. </p>
      <p> <img src="/images/discover/770vernon.jpg" alt="Photo of 770 Vernon Ave" width="233"
											   height="156" class="float-left" />Finally, in 1963 Wade
        Stockdill Armour &amp; Partners were appointed as architects for the new Municipal
        Hall, with John W. Armour in charge of Administration and Peter Blewett responsible
        for design. The firm was also hired to design the furniture and special fixtures in
        the building. Lone V. Nielsen did the interior design. In July, 1964, George H.
        Wheaton Limited (with a bid of $611,616) was hired as the construction firm. Philip
        Tattersfield and Associates were the landscape architects. The new hall was
        officially opened on December 1, 1965 by Lieutenant-Governor George R. Pearkes.
        Final cost, including furnishings, was about $800,000. It now accommodates about one
        hundred and fifty municipal inside employees. </p>
      <p> The flat-roofed building, constructed of reinforced concrete, has bands of windows
        the full length of the front and rear walls. Stairwells on the centre front and the
        south end are placed inside towers which exploit the sculptural properties of poured
        concrete. The front tower is a part of the ceremonial entranceway to the centre of
        civic government. This entranceway to the centre of civic government. This
        entranceway has a sweeping stairway up to a cantilevered deck which is used as a
        speakers' podium for civic ceremonies. Mature landscaping beautifully complements the
        facade. The interior concrete is given colour and warmth by the use of teak for
        paneling in the council chambers, and for balustrades and walls in public areas.</p>
      <h2>2755 Admirals Road&nbsp; (1854-1855) -
        Puget Sound Agricultural Company </h2>
      <p> <img src="/images/discover/2755admirals.jpg" alt="Photo of 2755 Admirals"
											   width="235" height="155" class="float-left" />The
        Craigflower Schoolhouse (originally called Maple Point School), the oldest surviving
        school building in Western Canada, was built on orders from Kenneth MacKenzie. He
        came from Scotland with his family in 1852, on the Hudson's Bay Company ship <em> Norman Morison</em>, to establish a farm for the Puget Sound Agricultural Company, a
        subsidiary of the Hudson's Bay Company. A school was needed for the children of farm
        employees, as well as those of arriving settlers. Gideon Halcro and his workmen began
        construction on Monday, August 21, 1854 and completed the project Friday, February
        23, 1855. Lumber and foundation bricks were produced at Craigflower Farm across the
        Gorge. Glass, hardware, and large bricks stamped &quot;Stourbridge,&quot; were
        imported from England. Total cost was about $4300. The two-storey building had one
        schoolroom, and six rooms for the teacher, his family and students boarders from the
        western communities. The school opened in March, 1855, the same week a ship's bell
        from the steamer <em>Major Tompkins</em>, wrecked off Macaulay Point, was hung in the
        yard. The first Craigflower bridge was built the next winter linking the school to
        the Craigflower settlement. The building became a focal point for social and
        religious events. It was used as a school until 1911, when the new Craigflower School
        was built across the road (superseded by a third building in 1964). The old school
        was vacant until it was converted to a museum which the Native Sons and Daughters of
        British Columbia ran from 1931 until 1975. The provincial Historic Parks and Sites
        Branch then acquired the property, restored it and reopened it as a museum. </p>
      <p> This simple Georgian Revival structure is side-gabled and has brick chimneys both
        ends. There is a large fireplace in the schoolroom and another in the teacher's
        quarters. The fourteen-inch-thick walls are composed of sawn clapboard siding
        applied to diagonal sheathing over standard Hudson's Bay Company log construction.
        Hewn horizontal logs were slid down from the top between vertical uprights, the
        joists hewn and sawn, and the roof timbers sawn. The building was set on a concrete
        foundation in 1929. </p>
      <h2>5071 West Saanich Road&nbsp; (1915-1918) - His Majesty the King in right of the Dominion of Canada </h2>
      <p> <img src="/images/discover/5071wsaanich.jpg" alt="Photo of 5071 W. Saanich Rd"
											   width="255" height="173" class="float-left" />The <a href="http://www.hia.nrc.ca/" target="_blank">Dominion Astrophysical Observatory </a> telescope was designed by Dr. John Stanley Plaskett, astronomer with the
        Department of the Interior in Ottawa. The 72-inch reflecting telescope was the
        largest of its kind in the world when it was built. The large mirror disc weighing
        1,960 pounds was made in Belgium at the St. Gobain glass works, and shipped from
        there just days before the beginning of World War One. The disc was ground at the
        John A. Brashear Company in Pittsburg. The sixty-six foot dome and mounting required
        to house the telescope was fabricated by the Warner and Swasey Company in Cleveland,
        Ohio. It was then dismantled and shipped to Victoria, where it was installed in the
        double-walled steel observatory constructed by the McAlpine-Robertson Company of
        Vancouver for a contract price of $75,000. Eight hundred tons of concrete were used
        in the construction of the foundation and piers inside the building, on which the
        telescope and its mounting rest. The buildings were designed by William Henderson,
        resident architect of the Dominion Public Works Department in Victoria. These
        included residences for the chief astronomer, Dr. Plaskett, and assistants, and an
        office building. </p>
      <p> Various areas in Western Canada were considered as possible sites for the
        observatory, but Saanich was chosen because of the stability of atmospheric
        conditions and the equability of year-round temperatures, more than for the clarity
        of its air. The provincial government constructed the road from West Saanich Road to
        the summit of Little Saanich Mountain as a relief project for the unemployed of the
        municipality. The province also contributed $10,000 to the project, which cost over
        $200,000. </p>
      <h2>4512 West Saanich Road&nbsp; (1911) -  Saanich Municipal Hall </h2>
      <p> <img src="/images/discover/4512wsaanich.gif" alt="Photo of 4512 W. Saanich Rd"
										       width="224" height="134" class="float-left" />Saanich was
        incorporated on March 1, 1906. Council meetings were held initially in the Hilliger
        house, and from February 9, 1907, in the converted James Pim farmhouse at the corner
        of Glanford and Vanalman Avenues. In the 1911 election debate over the location of
        the new municipal hall, Frederick and William James Quick were instrumental in
        choosing Royal Oak. John Charles Malcolm Keith, the architect of Christ Church
        Cathedral, designed the hall, C.H. Merkly built it for $4364, and D.L. Hickey and
        Company did the wiring for $288. The first addition was built in 1915 by Arthur
        Stewart. In 1948 Dillabough and Luney made repairs and built an addition. In 1958
        two huts from Gordon Head Camp were purchased and moved to the hall. The new
      municipal hall was opened in 1965. The old hall was sold and is now a restaurant. </p>
      <p> This hipped-roof building has been altered considerably over the years. The
        low-pitched, bell-cast roof has lost its open, octagonal cupola or bell-tower on the
        roof ridge. The symmetrical, formal front facade had a hipped-roof open entrance
        porch with proportionately large, square, shingled pillars. The building's
        fieldstone foundations are visible only from the parking lot, under a wooden ramp,
        and its former dark-stained shingles are now light. </p>
      <h2> 1950 Lansdowne Road&nbsp; (1913-1914) - His Majesty the King in Right of the Province of British
        Columbia </h2>
      <p> <img src="/images/discover/1950lansdwne.jpg" alt="Photo of 1950 Lansdowne Rd"
											   width="263" height="167" class="float-left" />The
        Provincial Normal School was opened January 4, 1915, with about fifty students. Its
        purpose was to train teachers for the elementary and high schools of British
        Columbia. The school drew its students from the islands, and the mainland east of
        Hope and north of Powell River. Teacher-trainees from the lower mainland and the
        Fraser Valley attended the provincial Normal School in Vancouver. The principal in
        Victoria was Donald L. MacLaurin and the head of the model school was Mr. McLean.
        The Young Building was named after the Hon. Dr. Henry Esson Young, Provincial
        Secretary and Minister of Education at the time. From 1942 until 1946, the school
        served as a military hospital. After the war, the campus was shared by the Normal
        School and Victoria College. They were united by statute in 1955 as Victoria College.
        The College moved to the new Gordon Head campus in 1967 and the young Building
        became the home of the Institute of Adult Studies. Three years later, as Camosun
        College, it became a two-year diploma-granting college, which has grown considerably
        in size. </p>
      <p> The Young Building was designed by Vancouver architect W.C.F. Gillam, who won the
        competition from among sixteen architects. It was constructed by Luney Brothers of
        Victoria for about $307,000. Although first designed in brick and terracotta, the
        provincial government requested that brick and stone be used, in order to give local
        employment and use local materials. Whitworth and Stewart of Vancouver did the
        masonry work with sandstone from the quarries of the Denman Island Stone Company.
        The roof slates were from a Welsh quarry. The building is in an eclectic Beaux
        Arts-style. The facade is symmetrical, with wings flanking the long horizontal mass
        of the main portion. This horizontality is emphasized by the contrasting sandstone
        first level and brick upper levels. These are divided by a sandstone string course,
        and the horizontal chamfering of the sandstone blocks on both the central entrance
        and the quoining of the wings. The monumental clock tower above the central entrance
        is visible for miles across the city, and the building is beautifully sited on the
        southern slope of Mount Tolmie. The symmetrical massing of the building is
        emphasized by the formal landscaping which includes a grand avenue of trees leading
        up from Lansdowne Road. </p>
      <h2>4139 Lambrick Way&nbsp; (ca. 1859)&nbsp;-
        Captain Charles and Grace Dodd </h2>
      <p> <img src="/images/discover/4139lambric.jpg" alt="Photo of 4139 Lambrick Way"
											   width="261" height="176" class="float-left" />This is the
        oldest house still standing in Saanich and was originally situated at 1710 Kenmore
        Road. It was built for the Dodds as a country home. Dodd, a servant of the Hudson's
        Bay Company, came to the Coast in 1836 on the paddle wheeler <em>S.S. Beaver</em>. He
        was promoted to master of the <em>Beaver</em> and later the <em>Labouchere</em>. He
        eventually became Chief Factor for the northwest coast, but died shortly afterwards
        on June 2, 1860. In accordance with Dodd's will, Roderick Finlayson and William
        Fraser Tolmie were appointed Trustees of his estate. A handsome tabletop monument
        over Dodd's grave still stands in Pioneer Square in Victoria. </p>
      <p> This simple, one-storey, cedar-shingled house is country Georgian in style. The
        interior, with its twelve-foot ceilings, is lined in redwood. In 1978 the house was
        moved from its original location at the corner of Kenmore Road and Torquay Drive by
        developer Charles Van Veen, who wished to subdivide the property where it stood. </p>
      <h2>3815 Haro Road&nbsp; (ca. 1911) -
        Letitia Jean and Algernon Henry Pease </h2>
      <p> <img src="/images/discover/3815haro.jpg" alt="Photo of 3815 Haro Rd" width="261"
										       height="180" class="float-left" />This water tower is one
        of the last remaining in the municipality. Until the Saanich Waterworks reached
        rural areas, many framers had water tanks in towers. This one was reportedly
        designed by architect Percy Leonard James, along with the Peases' house (part of
        which was moved and serves as the University of Victoria's Student Health Services
        Centre). The tower was originally a tank on a raised platform. In 1933 it was
        enclosed as a stable, with hayloft and tackroom in the tank section. Windows were
        added, it was shingled, given a shake roof, and the tank portion was covered in
        rough weatherboards. </p>
      <p> The Peases named their property &quot;Hamsterley Farm&quot; and operated a
        strawberry jam factory on it. After they sold it, they opened the &quot;Hamsterley
        Tea Room&quot; on the Malahat, then &quot;Hamsterley Lakeside&quot; and later the
        &quot;Toby Jug&quot; at Elk Lake.&nbsp; From 1933 to 1946 the property was owned by
        Alice Maud (Mrs. Fred) Robertson of &quot;The Spode Shop&quot;.&nbsp; She called the
        property &quot;Drummadoon,&quot; and it became &quot;Upper Drummadoon&quot; when her
        daughter's house, &quot;Lower Drummadoon,&quot; was built lower down the hill. </p>
