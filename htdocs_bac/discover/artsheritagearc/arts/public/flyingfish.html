      <p><a href="flying_brochure.pdf"><img src="../../../../images/discover/arts/public/flying_brochure.jpg" class="float-right" alt="Flying Fish Brochure"></a>In late 2005, the District of Saanich issued a Public Art proposal call to artists on Vancouver Island, and the Gulf Islands. The purpose of the call was to seek out an artist to create a piece of public art for the stairwell, leading up to the newly renovated training center. A jury composed of three local artists, a representative from the local neighbourhood association, and a staff member from the Parks and Recreation Department determined that the public art competition should address the broad theme of &ldquo;West Coast&rdquo;, and that the chosen artwork should acknowledge the existing artwork and colours found in the facility. </p>
      <p>When Saanich Commonwealth Place was originally constructed First Nation artist Roy Henry Vickers was commissioned to create artwork for the facility that would reflect the west coast landscape, and recognize the significance of the coastal aboriginal peoples in British Columbia&rsquo;s and Saanich&rsquo;s history and culture. The relief murals on the exterior of the building, and the totem pole in front of the building were both designed by Mr. Vickers.</p>
      <p>The artist selected for the public art project completed in conjunction with the newly upgraded training centre was Harumi Ota. Mr. Ota is an interdisciplinary artist, who formally trained in ceramics at the Kutani Ceramics Institute in Terai Japan, and has exhibited his work in Japan, New Zealand, the United States, and Canada. Mr. Ota and his family make their home in Saanich.      </p>
      <p>Harumi Ota created his artwork called <em><strong>&ldquo;Flying Fish&rdquo;</strong></em> based on an intermingling of West Coast First Nations and Japanese, culture and imagery.</p>
