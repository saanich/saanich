<h3>Goward Family Art Collection at Saanich Archives</h3>
<p>Saanich residents Elizabeth and Owen Goward were successful portrait, landscape and commercial artists from the late 1940s through to the 1980s and left a significant and lasting legacy to the Greater Victoria visual arts community.&nbsp;In 2007 the Goward family generously donated a significant collection of family records, photographs, letters, sketchbooks, and paintings to Saanich Archives.&nbsp;In addition to the works by Owen &amp; Elizabeth, the collection includes works of art by the Beales (Owen&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s family) dating back to the 1840s.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elizabeth and Owen Goward were married in Oregon in 1938.&nbsp;Eight years later they returned to Saanich to live in the Cadboro Bay home built by Owen&rsquo;s parents in 1908.&nbsp;These drawings by Elizabeth, of Owen and her art students, reflect their 45 years together in marriage and art.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Goward began painting portraits in 1920, when just ten years old.&nbsp;A graduate of the Art Institute of Philadelphia, she had a long career working primarily in oils and pastels &ndash; painting everyone from local families to Lieutenant Governors.</p>

<p>Mainly a portrait artist, Elizabeth Goward (1910-2002) also produced commercial art. Her line of greeting cards    from the circa 1960s show her additional talents as landscape artist.</p>

<p>Like his mother&rsquo;s (Beale)    side of the family, Owen Goward excelled at watercolours.&nbsp; Taught to paint by his governess as a    child, he studied art by correspondence through the Royal    Academy in London, England.&nbsp; His landscapes were exhibited at the Art Gallery    of Greater Victoria and across Canada in    collections owned by Canadian Pacific.</p>

<p> Owen Goward (1906-1983) also had a successful career as commercial artist.&nbsp;Clients such as Canadian Pacific Steamship Lines reproduced his watercolours in menu covers and advertisements.&nbsp;Like his wife he produced a line of greeting cards portraying scenes of British Columbia.</p>

<p>Saanich Archives has a large collection of Beale family watercolours dating back to the 1850s.&nbsp;The Beales, from Owen Goward&rsquo;s side of the family, lived in Europe and India for many years and documented their travels through watercolours.</p>

<p>In 1959 the Gowards opened Woodlands Studio at their family home in Cadboro Bay.&nbsp;Over the decades they held many exhibitions and art classes there.&nbsp;The family sold the home, now known as <a href="http://www.gowardhouse.com/">Goward House</a>, and 2.4 hectares of land to the Municipality of Saanich in 1973.&nbsp;It remains a cultural centre and park.</p>
