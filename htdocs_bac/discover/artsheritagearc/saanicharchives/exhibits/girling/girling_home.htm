    <p class="style10">The Girling Family Arrived in Saanich on Oct 4th, 1912 - 100 Years Ago </p>
    <p align="justify" class="style3">Anne Alice Girling was born in Suffolk, England in 1880 and studied photography at Woolwich Polytechnic before coming to Canada with her parents and siblings in 1912.&nbsp; The Girlings settled on the shores of Swan Lake in Saanich before moving to Thetis Lake and later to Finnerty Road where they converted an old school house to a family home.&nbsp; Annie never married and continued to live with family members in the Finnerty Road house until her death in 1953.</p>
    <p align="justify" class="style3">During Annie&rsquo;s lifetime she experimented with photographic methods, capturing images of her family and community as well as nature scenes and still lifes.&nbsp; She kept a darkroom in her home and developed her own images.&nbsp; Her collection of work, including many photographs of Saanich and Victoria taken from 1912 to the 1940s, consists of 916 images -- 535 glass plate negatives, 357 film negatives, and 24 prints.</p>
    <p align="justify" class="style3">The collection was nearly destroyed when the Finnerty Road house was demolished in the 1960s, but was rescued and preserved for over 30 years by Lindsay Lambert, a photographic historian.&nbsp; In 2008, Mr. Lambert generously donated Annie&rsquo;s 1901 field camera, plate holders, printing frames and collection of negatives to Saanich Archives.&nbsp; Descendants of the Girling family have helped immeasurably by identifying images and providing a wealth of background information.</p>
    <p align="justify"><span class="style3">A representative selection of Annie's photographs are presented on this website.&nbsp; Her complete work can be searched through Saanich Archives <a href="/webapp/saanichArchives/photo.jsp">online database</a><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; With its images of home, family and nature, this remarkable collection provides a rich record of the work of a female photographer in the early 20th century, and a glimpse of life in the young Municipality of Saanich.</span></p>
