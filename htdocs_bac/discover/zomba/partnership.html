      <p><img src="../../images/discover/zomba/committee-aug2005.jpg" class="float-left" alt=""> The Saanich Centennial Employees&rsquo; Committee came together in the summer of 2005. The committee
        has representatives from all Saanich departments. The committee began by trying to define a
        project. We felt that it was important to work in Zomba, a region where we have had a
        relationship since 1988, and where one committee member visited. </p>
      <p> We made contact with Judith Evans, an Adjunct Professor at the University of Victoria and
        expert in Early Childhood Development. Judith works with UNICEF, the UN, the World Bank and
        other international NGOs and has worked in Zomba and other African countries. </p>
      <p> <img src="../../images/discover/zomba/chancellor_college.jpg" class="float-right" alt=""> Through Judith, we learned about a student from Zomba, Khama Chibwana, who is studying at the
        University of Victoria.  When we made contact, we learned that Khama is on the teaching
        faculty of Chancellor College, and is studying Early Childhood Development. </p>
      <p> We explained our goals for an international project - that we wanted to work with children,
        support education and development and work in the Zomba region. We learned that Khama and his
        department at Chancellor College were interested in initiating a childcare community centre in
        Magalasi, a poor rural area within greater Zomba.  They had staff, students and the background
        to run the project, but no funding. </p>
      <p> We realized that this was the makings of a partnership - Chancellor College could deliver the
        project on the ground, and we could provide the funding. Since then, volunteers on the Saanich
        Employees&rsquo; Centennial Committee have been working with Judith Evans, Khama Chibwana, and
        faculty from Chancellor College to write a memorandum of understanding between the two
        partners.  The agreement will identify project activities, who is responsible (Centennial
        Committee, College, Magalasi community volunteers), timing, and funding levels.</p>
