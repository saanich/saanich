                  <p>Welcome to our new GORP website, just in time to celebrate!</p>
                  <p>We are excited to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Garry Oak Restoration Project in Saanich.&nbsp; In late November of 1999, the first meeting to develop this program was held.&nbsp; Over ten years we have built a successful and thriving volunteer stewardship program, we have advanced our knowledge and planning for ecological restoration, we see significant improvements to the ecosystems and we continue to engage the community in the recovery of Garry oak ecosystems.&nbsp; On behalf of Saanich and the GORP Steering Committee, we want to thank everyone who has shared their talents, knowledge, passion and time.&nbsp; You have all helped to create a community of support that is still growing!</p>

                  <p><strong>GORP Announces New Leadership for 2010</strong></p>
                  <p>For the first 10 years of GORP, the program has been managed by Saanich Environmental Services with Saanich Parks as a partner.&nbsp; At the November Steering Committee meeting, Saanich staff announced a leadership change for GORP. &nbsp;As of January 2010, the program will now be managed by Saanich Parks.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p>The leadership change considered that all nine GORP sites at within Saanich Parks and that Parks now has an additional staff member dedicated to natural areas management.&nbsp; In addition, coordinating GORP from within Saanich Parks has an operational benefit and allows GORP to be managed in the context of the significant increase in stewardship projects in Saanich Parks over the last 10 years.</p>
                  <p>Saanich Parks staff taking on key roles in GORP will include <span style="font-weight: bold">Cory Manton</span>, Manager of Horticulture, Urban Forestry and Natural Areas.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold">Carolyn MacDonald</span>, who has been coordinating and chairing, will remain on the Steering Committee.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold">Jenny Eastman</span> will remain the Coordinator of Volunteers for the program.</p>
                  <p>GORP marks 10 successful years of stewardship and restoration in Saanich this November.&nbsp; We hope you can join us in celebrating.</p>
