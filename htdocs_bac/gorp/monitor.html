            <p> Monitoring of the sites will be taking place through two methods:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Photopoint Monitoring </strong>will provide seasonal/ annual images that are standardized and imbedded with key information about the site and image. A series of precise photos will provide valuable records as well as qualitative and quantitative information about the status of restoration on each site. This monitoring technique will take place with the help of trained volunteers.<a href="pdf/ppm_brochure.pdf"><br>

              </li>
              <li> <strong>Volunteer Stewards</strong> of GORP sites provide monitoring information through field log forms, including notes about flora, fauna and anything affecting restoration on the sites.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Inventories of the sites are also very important, especially for planning purposes. Ideally, these inventories will be updated as funding allows. Three inventories of the GORP sites have been conducted:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> <strong>Vegetation Inventory</strong> conducted by RNS (Restoration of Natural Systems) students, Fran Spencer and Derek Bedford. An Inventory and Description of Garry Oak Restoration Project Sites, July 2001 <br>
              </li>
              <li> <strong>Soil Inventory</strong> conducted by Bob Maxwell and RNS student, Moss Gleason (spring 2002) <br>
              </li>
              <li> <strong>Wildlife Inventory</strong> conducted by RNS students Moralea Milne and Candus McLellan (spring 2002)<br>
              </li>
              <li><strong>New </strong>individual site inventory lists are currently under development.</li>
