      <h2><strong>District of Saanich Recognized for Taking Action on Climate Change</strong></h2>
      <p> The Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) and ICLEI &ndash; Local Governments for Sustainability is recognizing the District of Saanich for taking steps to reduce GHGs and improve energy efficiency, achieving Milestone 5 of the Partners for Climate Protection (PCP) program for community and corporate programs. Saanich becomes that 8th Canadian municipality to accomplish this prestigious achievement. The Municipality&rsquo;s list of programs, initiatives and progress reporting can be found at <a href="http://www.climateaction.saanich.ca/">www.climateaction.saanich.ca</a></p>
      <p>Saanich Mayor Frank Leonard is proud of how the Municipality has quietly become a Canadian leader in climate action. &ldquo;Through a combination of unique and practical steps, Saanich has been able to integrate sustainability and climate action throughout our community and our operations. Our Official Community Plan, strategic planning, financial reporting and day-to-day operations all support our greenhouse gas reduction efforts.&rdquo;<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong></strong>Municipalities have direct or indirect control over approximately 44 per cent of Canada&rsquo;s GHG emissions. While all orders of government need to work together to reduce Canada&rsquo;s GHGs, municipalities can and are taking effective action themselves.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong></strong>The <a href="http://www.fcm.ca/pcp">PCP program</a> is a results-oriented network of Canadian municipal governments that have committed to reducing GHGs and acting on climate change. Member municipalities progress through a series of five milestones that help them to build their capacity to reduce GHGs: <strong><a href="../../../../images/living/climate/progress/climate%20graph.jpg" class="lightbox"><img src="../../../../images/living/climate/progress/climate%20graph.jpg" alt="Climate Graph" width="300" height="205" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" align="right"></a></strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a GHG emissions inventory and forecast.</li>
        <li>Set an emissions reductions target.</li>
        <li>Develop a local action plan.</li>
        <li>Implement the local action plan or a set of activities.</li>
        <li>Monitor progress and report results. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The District of Saanich is in good company. Together, PCP members have invested over $2 billion to date to mitigate climate change, implementing more than 800 green projects or measures and reducing GHGs by 1.8 million tonnes. These results are tracked and reported annually in the <a href="http://www.fcm.ca/home/programs/partners-for-climate-protection/national-measures-report.htm">PCP National Measures Report</a>. PCP is the Canadian component of ICLEI's Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) network, which involves more than 1,100 communities worldwide. </p>
