      <h2 align="left"><strong>Greener Garbage Collection Starts Spring 2014</strong></h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>The District of Saanich is pleased to introduce Greener Garbage Collection.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Starting Spring 2014, Saanich residential garbage customers will be asked to divert kitchen scraps, food leftovers and food-soiled paper products from their household garbage for pick-up in a separate organics recycling cart. A great new feature of Greener Garbage Collection is that yard trimmings can be added to the organics recycling cart for collection too.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>To collect both garbage and organics recycling efficiently and control costs, Saanich will move to automated curbside collection where carts are emptied from the curb using a mechanical arm on a truck. Assistance programs will be available for those not able to place their carts curbside on collection day.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>All Saanich garbage customers will receive a kitchen container for daily collection of kitchen scraps, a green organics recycling wheeled cart and a grey garbage wheeled cart which are compatible with automated collection. In June 2013, customers will be asked to choose cart sizes that best meet their needs following a use less, pay less system which relates to the size of the carts they choose. </p>
      <p>Most households will see their collection costs remain about the same, depending on the cart sizes they choose. </p>
      <p>In 2013, Saanich garbage collection customers will pay $156 for solid waste services; this appears as a separate line item on property taxes. In 2014, this will be replaced with property owners paying an annual base fee of $105 for solid waste services plus an annual cart fee for their garbage and organics recycling carts. The cart fees being charged relate to the weight-based disposal fees at the Hartland landfill for garbage and at the processing facility for organics recycling. </p>
      <p>Additional carts will be available to single and multi-family households for an additional cart fee. Saanich will maintain its current sticker and special pick-up programs. Cart sizes and fees are listed below. </p>

      <p></p>
      <br>
      <p>Providing organics recycling is a big step towards making Saanich cleaner, greener and more sustainable and will substantially reduce the amount of garbage taken to the landfill. With the ban on kitchen scraps at the landfill coming into effect January 1, 2015, Saanich is providing more opportunities for customers to recycle, choose cart sizes that best meet their needs and divert 8,000 tonnes of organics from the landfill every year. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Garbage and organics recycling will be collected on the same day, every second week. The organics recycling collected from more than 31,000 Saanich households will be recycled into nutrient-rich compost.</p>
