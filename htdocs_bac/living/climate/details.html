      <h2>2006 - Climate Change and Energy Action Plan Initiated</h2>
      <p> Council adopted the <a href="" target="_blank">NEED LINK 2007 - 2011 Saanich Strategic
        Plan</a> in December. The Strategic Plan has three significant climate change and
        environmental initiatives included in the 2007 work plan under the Sustainable Environment
        Theme Group: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Complete the pilot project "Community Action on Energy Efficiency" including a private
          sector green building policy. </li>
        <li> Develop a Saanich Climate Change and Energy Action Plan following the completion of the
          CRD Community Energy Plan. </li>
        <li>Develop a Corporate environmental management plan.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> In January 2007, Council approved a $288,000 funding application to the UBCM Gas Tax
        Innovations Fund to develop a <a href="pdf/sustainable_actionplan.pdf"
					    	target="_blank">Sustainable Saanich Action Plan</a> <img src="/images/logos/pdf.gif"
					    	alt="pdf">. The Action Plan will include a Community Climate Change and Energy Strategy and a
        Corporate Environment Management Strategy. The Saanich Environmental Advisory, and Planning,
        Transportation and Economic Development Advisory Committees will jointly advise on climate
        change, energy efficiency and environment management initiatives, with the Planning Department
        coordinating staff efforts (Joint Advisory Committee on Climate Change {JACCC}). </p>
      <p> Public feedback is vital in developing and implementing a Sustainable Saanich Action Plan, so
        the project will offer a wide range of community input opportunities. <strong>As a start, we
          encourage you to forward your ideas on how Saanich should address climate change, green house
          gas reductions and energy efficiency to</strong> <a href="mailto:climatechange@saanich.ca">climatechange@saanich.ca</a>. </p>

      <h2>2007 - CRD Community Energy Plan Completed</h2>
      <p> The Capital Region Community Energy Plan (CEP) is a guide for regional climate change
        initiatives. The energy inventory and CEP reports were completed in 2006. The CEP sets six
        goals for energy savings and greenhouse gas reduction and outlines actions to achieve them.
        The plan indicates that Saanich has the potential to achieve a GHG reduction of up to 13.5%
        below 1995 levels. </p>

      <h2>2007 - Carbon Neutral Plan Adopted</h2>
      <p> On September 17, 2007 Saanich Council approved the Carbon Neutral Plan for implementation in
        2008. </p>
      <p> The plan contains two key strategies: </p>
      <ol id="spaced">
        <li>Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Reductions Reduce corporate GHG emissions by implementing building, fleet and other operational efficiencies, aiming for a 10% reduction by 2010</li>
        <li>Establishment of a Municipal Carbon-Neutral Reserve Fund In order to ensure that carbon offset funds stay within the municipality, a municipal carbon-neutral reserve fund is proposed to be established that would off-set the annual GHG emissions resulting from all municipal (corporate) operations.</li>
      </ol>
      <p> The Carbon-Neutral Reserve Fund is proposed to be used only for new GHG-reducing initiatives within Saanich, such as solar hot water, geo-exchange, photo-voltaic systems or other forms of electrical generation, fleet conversion, transportation demand management, building energy retrofits, urban forestry and other operational improvements that reduce GHG emissions.

        climate action a reality. Our Climate Action Coordinator can be reached at 250-475-5494 ext
        3466 for any inquiries you may have. </p>
      <a name="climateProtectionMilestone2" id="climateProtectionMilestone2"></a>
      <h2>2008 - Partners for Climate Protection Milestone 2 Reached</h2>
      <p> This milestone was achieved by setting a corporate target of 10% reduction in GHG emissions by
        2010. Using our 2004 baseline data, our efforts will focus on buildings, fleets, lighting and
        pumping systems at the municipality. This goal will be achieved through the programs such as
        the E-Fleet Program and the energy audit and retrofit of municipal buildings. </p>
      <a name="calculator" id="calculator"></a>
      <h2>2008 - Saanich Carbon Neutral Donation Calculator Launched</h2>
      <p> The District of Saanich has developed an on-line Carbon Neutral Donation Calculator that
        allows Saanich residents to calculate their household carbon footprint. The user-friendly
        calculator asks you to list vehicle travel data, air trips, hydro bills, gas and heating oil
        usage, and then calculates how many metric Tonnes of greenhouse gases your household has
        emitted in a year. </p>
      <p> Once calculated, your carbon footprint can be "neutralized" by donating to Saanich's Carbon
        Neutral Reserve Fund. A tax-deductable receipt will be issued. </p>
