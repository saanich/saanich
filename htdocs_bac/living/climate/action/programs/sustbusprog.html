      <p>To support Saanich&rsquo;s efforts on climate action in the community, we want to help Saanich
        businesses reduce their environmental impacts and carbon footprint while saving money at the
        same time. See what&rsquo;s possible by joining one of our two new Sustainable Business
        Programs. Which one is your business ready for?</p>
<img src="../../../../images/living/climate/climatesmart_small.jpg" alt="" class="float-left">
      <h2>25&nbsp;Saanich businesses to receive $1,000 sponsorship for training to cut costs by cutting their carbon footprint </h2>
      <p><strong>Businesses will be accepted upon a first-come first-served basis. Go to&nbsp;the <a href="http://www.climatesmartbusiness.com/crd" target="_blank">Climate Smart website</a> for further details and to register to be one of the 25&nbsp;Saanich businesses in this program.</strong></p>
      <p>The ClimateSmart program teaches businesses how to measure their carbon footprint, identify ways to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and learn about becoming carbon neutral.&nbsp; Marketing and communications are also included in the three half-day workshops and participants are provided access to an online tool to calculate and manage their carbon footprint, as well as one-on-one technical advice.</p>
      <p>25 businesses from both Saanich and Victoria&nbsp;will be eligible for the $1,000 subsidy that is being offered through this funding, bringing the cost of the training down to $250 for a micro-business (1-10FTE), $500 for a small business (11-50 FTE), $750 for a medium business (51-200 FTE) and $1,000 for a large business (201-500).&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Half of each $1,000 subsidy will come from the CRD and with the municipalities covering the other half for their respective businesses.</p>
      <p>"By working across our municipal boundaries we are looking to help promote ClimateSmart businesses on a more regional level- so whether you are a paving company in Saanich or a hotel in Victoria, local businesses will have the support needed to reduce their costs and carbon footprint" said Saanich Mayor Frank Leonard.</p>
      <h3>Local ClimateSmart Businesses</h3>
      <p>Accent Inns, Rogers Chocolates and Capital City Paving are three examples of businesses that have recently completed the ClimateSmart program.&nbsp; "For our team at Accent Inns, mapping out our energy use and seeing where we had opportunities to reduce our environmental impacts and maximize our cost savings was a powerful process.&nbsp; Making real changes like installing energy efficient lights and occupancy sensors&nbsp;for&nbsp;heating rooms hearing our guests acknowledge those efforts, has made our team even prouder of what we do.&nbsp; It's really a win-win for everyone,"&nbsp;noted&nbsp;CEO of Accent Inns Mandy Farmer.</p>
