      <p>The municipal police board is the governing body of the
        independent municipal police department and provides a vital
        link between the police and the community they serve.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.saanichpolice.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=208&Itemid=18" target="_blank"> Saanich Police Board</a> generally meets the first Tuesday
        of every month; however, the Board does not usually meet
        in July and August.&nbsp;The members may be asked
        to sit on sub-committees or attend other meetings as required.</p>

      <h2>Composition of the Police Board</h2>
      <p>The <em>Police Act </em>requires that the board consist of
        the Mayor, who is designated as Chair, one person appointed
        by the Council and not more than five persons appointed
        by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council.&nbsp; <a href="pdf/Council%20&%20Committee%20List%202013%20Appointments%20Update%20SEP17%202013.pdf">Board
          members<img src="/images/logos/pdf.gif" alt="pdf document"></a> are appointed to a term not to exceed three
        years and, although they may be reappointed, they cannot
        hold office for more than six consecutive years. Appointments
        are initially for one year, can be renewed for two years,
        and again for three years.&nbsp; Terms begin and expire
        June 30th.&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Duties and Functions</h2>
      <h3>Policy Development </h3>
      <p>The board has the responsibility to set the overall policy
        for the department and to ensure that procedures are in place
        to carry out that policy. The chief constable is responsible
        to the board for ensuring that departmental procedures and
        overall management are designed in accordance with board policy.</p>
      <h3>Hiring a Chief Constable </h3>
      <p>One of the most important tasks a municipal police board undertakes
        is to hire a chief constable for the department. The chief
        constable is the chief executive officer of the department,
        overseeing the hiring of personnel, staff discipline, financial
        administration and the quality and level of policing services
        provided to the community. Hiring for this position requires
        careful planning and a clear understanding of the needs of
        the department and the community beforehand.</p>
      <h3>Budgeting</h3>
      <p>The municipal police board must submit a budget, prepared
        in consultation with the chief constable and senior staff
        which estimates what monies will be required for the coming
        year to provide policing in the municipality.</p>
      <h3>Collective Bargaining</h3>
      <p>The municipal police board is the employer of both officers
        and civilian personnel in the department. As such, the board
        has the ultimate responsibility for negotiating the collective
        agreement with the association or bargaining unit representing
        the employees.</p>
      <h3>Community Relations </h3>
      <p>Municipal police boards, comprised of community members who
        are appointed to provide citizen oversight of police departments,
        are in a unique position to provide leadership in police/community
        relations. Police Departments are increasingly moving towards
        various forms of community policing, e.g. store front offices,
        neighbourhood watch programs, school programs and bike patrols,
        aimed at the prevention of crime, and improved detection and
        apprehension of offenders.</p>
      <p>Board members, in their role as governors of the department,
        should support and encourage these initiatives and demonstrate
        to the community, by their own involvement, that increased
        citizen participation will assist in making their community
        a safer place to live.</p>
