      <h2><a name="senior" id="senior"></a>Senior Friendly Pilot Project</h2>
      <p>
        The Healthy Saanich Advisory Committee is currently developing a programme to encourage businesses to adopt suggested guidelines and criteria to eliminate or reduce some of the challenges that seniors face every day.&nbsp; The criteria are based on the results of a survey completed by seniors within the pilot project area earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The Pilot Project Area is defined along Shelbourne Street, between Feltham Road and Cedar Hill Cross Road.&nbsp; This area is also defined in the Regional Growth Strategy as a major centre/urban village, and Saanich will be looking at development guidelines to make this area evolve accordingly.&nbsp; The corridor also has the highest number of seniors living within a 15-minute walk of a commercial centre.&nbsp; Finally, statistics confirm that by 2010, one in five residents in Saanich will be over the age of 65.</p>
      <p>Although the neighbourhood is predominantly apartments and condominiums with some single family dwellings, there are many seniors&rsquo; complexes and care homes.&nbsp; It is well recognized how important it is to allow seniors to age in place, and remain independent for as long as possible.&nbsp; This area offers a variety of retail outlets, banking facilities, restaurants and coffee shops, churches, medical offices and services, a recreation centre, a library,&nbsp; movie theatres and has access to reliable and frequent public transportation.</p>
      <p><img src="/images/discover/seniorservice.jpg" class="float-right" alt="seniorservice.jpg" />The long-term goal of our project is to engage not only the businesses within the pilot area, but eventually throughout the municipality, and have &ldquo;<em>Saanich Senior Friendly</em>&rdquo; decals prominently displayed so that seniors know that the particular business or service has taken steps to ensure that it has adapted to meet seniors&rsquo; needs as they continue to be active in their community, doing their day to day business.</p>
      <h2><a name="global" id="global"></a>Global Age-Friendly Cities Project </h2>
      <p>
        Saanich is experiencing a demographic shift as are many other cities in the world. Our populations are aging and we need to plan for this change in a positive way. According to the United Nations one million people worldwide turn 60 every month!</p>
      <p>Recently the Province of British Columbia selected Saanich to be their partner city to collaborate with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other cities in this world-wide project to make cities more &ldquo;age-friendly&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>The project focuses on the &ldquo;lived&rdquo; experience of older people &ndash; that is what seniors experience in their daily lives in the community. WHO and partners from many countries, including Health Canada, will first consult with older persons, and then with community leaders and experts to identify the major physical and social barriers to active aging. WHO will then compile the results to create the practical &ldquo;Age-Friendly City&rdquo; guidelines that could be used by cities around the world.</p>
