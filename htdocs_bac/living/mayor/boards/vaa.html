      <p>The Authority is a legal entity incorporated
        under the <em>Canada Corporations Act</em> as a &quot;not for
        profit&quot; organization. This means that the corporation
        cannot distribute any profits by way of dividends to its
        members. It can however make a profit in the normal business
        sense to provide for its ongoing viability. The common British
        Columbia equivalent organization is a society.</p>

      <h2>TERMS OF REFERENCE - Guidelines</h2>
      <p><h3>Purpose </h3></p>
      <p>The purpose of the Authority is to take over the operation
        of the Victoria airport under a 60 (renewable to 80) year
        lease from Transport Canada, acting for the Federal government.</p>
      <p><h3>Mandate</h3></p>
      <p>The mandate for the Authority is to operate a safe, efficient,
        modern airport to serve over 350,000 people residing in approximately
        twenty municipalities from Duncan south. There is no other
        airport for the bulk of this population - which is expected
        to grow to over 500,000 in the fairly near future. Indeed,
        it is unlikely that there is even a suitable site for another
        airport, and the smaller airport at Nanaimo is not a realistic
        alternative.</p>
      <p><h3>Membership</h3></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The only members are the directors, and vice-versa.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Membership as noted above.</li>
        <li>All appointments are made by the board to ensure that
          directors meet qualifications set out by Transport Canada.
          No government (including municipal) employees or elected
          officials are permitted to sit on the board, and the board
          as a whole is required to be comprised of people having
          a variety of relevant skills and experience.</li>
        <li>The directors are required to act in the best interests
          of the Authority, not to merely represent the interests
          of their nominators.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><h3>Authority communication with other municipalities
        and nominating entities </h3></p>
      <p>At the request of any nominator, the corporation shall cause
        a meeting to be held with the duly authorized representatives
        of the nominator at which the Chair and such other directors
        of the corporation as the Chair deems appropriate shall be
        present to respond to questions on matters of public interest
        concerning the business of the corporation. The nominator's
        request shall state the general nature of the business desired
        to be discussed.</p>
      <p>In addition:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>at least once a year, each director must give to the
          director's nominator a report containing non-confidential
          information in general terms as to the affairs of the
          corporation. (At the discretion of the board, that report
          may be made by way of a report by the board as a whole
          made collectively to all nominators.);</li>
        <li>the airport management staff maintains close communication
          with municipal officials;</li>
        <li>the board is required to negotiate with North Saanich
          and Sidney with respect to land use plans and associated
          matters, such as the provision of services and facilities;</li>
        <li>local municipal governments are invited to membership
          on the Authority's &quot;Airport Consultative Committee.&quot; This
          committee is comprised of representatives of various interest
          groups as well as the local municipalities, and discussion
          takes place with respect to airport affairs generally.
          This committee must meet at least twice per year.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><h3>Public Communication with the Authority</h3></p>
      <p>Once per year, the Authority is required to hold a public
        meeting, at which plans and financial reports are tabled.
        Members of the public are permitted to speak and ask questions
        at this meeting. Also, as noted above, the public is represented
        on the Airport Consultative Committee.</p>
      <p>The public is also entitled to access much written information
        about airport plans and affairs.</p>
      <p><h3>Property Taxes</h3></p>
      <p>The Authority pays property taxes by direct taxation in the
        ordinary sense. Tenants on airport lands will continue to
        be assessed and pay taxes.</p>
