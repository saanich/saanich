      <h3>Terms of Reference</h3>
      <p>The Board of Variance is a statutory committee that has
        the power to grant minor variances in situations where compliance
        with the Zoning Bylaw respecting the siting, dimension or
        size of a building or structure would cause a person undue
        hardship. A variance may not vary the density or use of
        land, and if granted, will expire two years from the date
        of approval. </p>
