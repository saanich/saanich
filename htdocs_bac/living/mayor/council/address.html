      <p><strong>Mayors Annual Address - December 3, 2012 </strong></p>
      <p>It is a pleasure to present the Mayor&rsquo;s Annual Address for 2012. Summaries of our accomplishments from 2012 and our goals for 2013 are contained in the appendices, so I will comment on a few of them in my remarks tonight.</p>
      <p>Successive Councils have increased infrastructure spending for more than ten years and we have now reached sustainable funding levels for fleet vehicles and equipment. Appendix F details more than $30 million of infrastructure spending in 2013 and this will bring us closer to reaching all of our targets between 2015 and 2019.          </p>

          One of the most significant infrastructure projects is the replacement of the Rithet Reservoir. The reconstruction of the Reservoir represents a milestone for the Municipality not only because it will be the largest single waterworks project in several decades, but also because the replacement of this reservoir will advance our efforts in three important areas simultaneously; infrastructure renewal, environmental stewardship and emergency preparedness. The existing reservoir was constructed in 1950&rsquo;s. We currently lose approximately 100,000 gal of water through the floor of the reservoir each day and the structure does not meet current seismic codes. The proposed reservoir will renew a key component of our waterworks system, eliminate the loss of potable water and, because it will be constructed to stringent seismic standards, we can be confident of supplying sufficient water to the community post disaster. Design work on the Rithet reservoir is 80% complete and construction should start in early 2013.</p>
      <p>In terms of infrastructure, the replacement of the Craigflower Bridge in partnership with the Town of View Royal will also dominate our 2013 work plan.</p>
      <p>Ensuring a safe community is always front of mind and Block Watch is one of the flagships of our public safety programs with 28 new blocks added in 2012. This increase resulted from a very successful campaign targeting non-Block Watch neighbourhoods that were experiencing property crimes. I&rsquo;m also pleased to report that the Crime Free Multi-housing component of Blockwatch expanded by four buildings in 2012 with another 20 in process.</p>
      <p>Saanich Police has the second largest traffic unit in BC. The mandate of the Traffic Safety Unit (TSU) is to reduce the frequency and severity of crashes in Saanich. To do this the TSU targets high crash locations where enforcement has the greatest impact. Initial reports indicate a decrease in crashes, however, Saanich Police will monitor the crash rate over the long term to better assess the impact.</p>
      <p>Our Fire Department implemented a smoke alarm replacement program and campaign for Fire Prevention Week. The goal is to see a working smoke alarm in every home in Saanich and is part of a Province wide initiative supported by the Fire Chiefs Association of BC. This will be an on-going public safety program where Saanich residents having difficulty checking, installing or maintaining their Smoke Alarms will be assisted by staff. The program is being well received and is a key public safety initiative for supporting &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; populations within our community.</p>
      <p>This year, we are pleased to contract with the City of Colwood and Town of View Royal to provide regional fire dispatch and records management system services. Consistent with our commitment to the integration of public safety service, we are now providing regional dispatch service to seven Fire Departments. In addition to generating revenue, the regional approach to dispatch services is providing a cost effective service delivery model and supports a shared approach to accessing current dispatch technology and support systems. </p>
      <p>I can also advise that Saanich Police will enter into a partnership with the Vancouver Island Integrated Major Crime Unit (VIIMCU) by hiring and assigning additional staff to the unit in an effort to improve efficiencies and effectiveness in relation to homicide investigations. Despite this partnership having a significant financial impact, I wish to stress that the Saanich Police Department will continue to participate in all other regional units.</p>
      <p>One of the most significant decisions Council has recently made is to implement a curbside refuse and kitchen scraps collection program which uses municipal crews and has an assistance component. There are numerous details to work through &ndash; types of bins, what to do with old garbage cans, how to administer assistance programs, etc &ndash; but the key is to get from &ldquo;here to there&rdquo; so that kitchen waste is composted rather than buried and we significantly extend our regional landfill. I&rsquo;m confident and determined, just as councillors and staff are, that we will succeed.</p>
      <p>We are almost ready to embark on the concept planning process for Panama Flats. However, there is one change that I&rsquo;m asking staff to report on. The expectation is that following a planning process to determine land use at Panama Flats, some of the lands may then be added to the Agricultural Land Reserve. My question is: perhaps we should add lands to the ALR first and then discuss what the land could be used for. If our Planning Department agrees with this approach, I&rsquo;m asking for recommendations to come before Council.</p>
      <p>One of the suggestions for part of Panama Flats has been allotment gardens. In the meanwhile, we are pleased to advise that progress has now been made towards establishing two new community garden sites, one in Gorge Park and one behind Saanich Commonwealth Place. Staff will be undertaking consultations with the community in both areas in the near future and should there be support for these potential sites, work will continue towards establishing operating agreements with local groups and having these areas ready to plant in the spring of 2013. </p>
      <p>Before closing, I&rsquo;d like to draw attention to a couple of programs that we are a part of. These two programs are innovative, collaborative and are having a big impact in small ways.</p>
      <p>First, we&rsquo;re working with community sport organizations to implement after school programs at Tillicum and Craigflower Schools incorporating the &ldquo;Sport for Life&rdquo; (S4L) philosophy and approaches. Funded by Canadian Tire Jump Start and in partnership with School District #61, after school play and sport programs are providing children the opportunity to be physically active and socially engaged. Instructors from PISE (Pacific Institute of Sport Excellence) teach children basic physical literacy skills: how to run, throw and jump. Over 125 children are learning skills they otherwise would not have had the opportunity to learn due to their inability to afford a membership in a sports program. </p>
      <p>Second, a Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) Age Friendly Community Planning and Projects Grant has enabled staff to establish free community kitchen programs for seniors throughout Saanich. These six week programs, in partnership with Vancouver Island Health Authority (VIHA), provide often isolated and at risk seniors living alone, the opportunity to cook and share a meal with others, then take home freezer ready extras for another day. Approximately 60 seniors have participated in the programs to date and while the nutritional component of the program has been well received, the social connection for participants has been invaluable.</p>
      <p>The programs and projects I&rsquo;ve outlined tonight are examples of what is working here in Saanich. Council has set strategic goals for our community; we have a strong management team leading initiatives to achieve these goals; and we have great front-line staff making a difference with the programs and projects as a result.</p>
      <p>Based on this success, I am confident 2013 will be another year of achievements.</p>
      <p>Thank you.</p>
