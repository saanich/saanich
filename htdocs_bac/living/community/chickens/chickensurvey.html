      <p>In 2009 many residents of Saanich requested that Council amend the Animals Bylaw to allow the keeping of Chickens on smaller properties than what was currently allowed in the Animals Bylaw.&nbsp; A petition, letters, and e-mail had been received requesting that the keeping of chickens be allowed on property with an area less than 1,114.8 sq.m &nbsp; (12,000 sq.ft).</p>
      <p>Saanich Council requested staff to receive and consider feed back from community stakeholders and residents; and to provide options for allowing chickens on residential property of less than 1,114.8 m2 (12,000 ft2) in a report to Council.</p>
      <p>Saanich staff reviewed regulations pertaining to the keeping of chickens in other North American municipalities; consulted Council committees, community associations and the Peninsula Agriculture Commission; conducted a survey to gather resident&rsquo;s opinion on keeping chickens on smaller lots; and held two open houses to provide residents the opportunity to discuss the keeping of chickens in urban residential areas.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>On June 14, 2011, following the bylaw amendment review process and a public hearing, Saanich Council approved an amendment to the Animals Bylaw to allow up to five (5) chickens on single family residential property with an area greater than 557 m2 (6,000 ft2).&nbsp; </p>
