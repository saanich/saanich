      <h2>Steps to Keeping Backyard Chickens</h2>
      <p>Please take the time to review the information below before getting your backyard hens.</p>
      <h3> Step 1 - Municipal Regulations</h3>
      <p>Prospective backyard hen owners are required to familiarize themselves with the relevant sections of the <a href="../../pdf/animals8556.pdf">Animals By-law</a>. This bylaw sets out the rules and requirements for keeping backyard chickens, including the maximum number of hens, the size and location of chicken coops and other important details. </p>
      <h3> Step 2 - Important Information: Hen Care<a name="hencare"></a></h3>
      <p><em>Hen owners are also required to review the following documents before registering their hens:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="docs/HenBasics.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Basic Hen Care</strong></a> - This information was compiled from a list of sources provided at the end of the document. This information should be used as a starting point for understanding the best management practices for the keeping of chickens in an urban area.</li>
        <li><a href="docs/ChickenComposting.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Composting</strong></a> - One benefit of keeping chickens, besides the egg production and pet enjoyment, is the resulting chicken manure that, after composting, will give your garden a high-energy dose of nutrients. Chicken manure straight from the chicken, however, is too high in nitrogen for delicate plants, and can burn them. Aging chicken manure by composting reduces the nitrogen content and provides a balance of nutrients.</li>

      </ul>

      <dt class="slideToggle">How will hens be protected from inhumane
        acts?</dt>
      <dd> Humane care of animals is the responsibility of the owners. Owners should educate
          themselves on the proper and humane care for all animals. The BC Prevention of Cruelty
          to Animals Act ensures the humane treatment of animals by providing a legislative
          mandate for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in British Columbia.
          It outlines the powers of their offices, rights of seizure and disposal or sale of
          animals taken into custody. Reporting of inhumane acts against animals is the
          responsibility of each of us in our society. <br>

      <dt class="slideToggle"> Where on our property may we keep chickens?</dt>
      <dd>Hens are allowed within the rear yard of your property as defined in the Animals Bylaw and 3m from the side and rear lot lines. Hens must be kept in an enclosure with a combination of a secured indoor area and an outdoor covered and fenced pen as outlined in the Animals Bylaw. </dd>
      <dt class="slideToggle">Who should a Saanich resident contact in the
        case they have a complaint about a neighbour keeping chickens?</dt>
      <dd>Please first check Saanich's Animals Bylaw to understand if the owner of the hens is actually operating against the bylaw. If the hen owner is working contrary to the bylaw it is always best to contact the owner to make them aware of the infraction as they may wish to be a good neighbour and change the situation to abide by the bylaw. If there is still a problem you may contact Saanich Animal Control to report an infraction to the Animal Bylaw. </dd>
