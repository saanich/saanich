      <h2>Council Meeting</h2>
      <p>The proposed rezoning application will be considered by Council at the upcoming June 24th, 2013 Committee of the Whole Meeting. The companion staff Council Report can be <strong><u><a href="http://www.saanich.ca/business/development/reports/rez00504.pdf" target="_blank">viewed online</a></u></strong>. The meeting starts at 7:30 p.m. and is held in Council Chamber at the Municipal Hall (770 Vernon Avenue). If you wish to provide input to Council, you can do so in any of the following ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Write Council a letter (c/o Legislative Services, 770 Vernon Avenue, Victoria BC, V8X 2W7).</li>
        <li><a href="mailto:council@saanich.ca">E-mail Council</a>.</li>
        <li> Attend the Committee of the Whole Meeting and/or Public Hearing and speak with Council directly. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Assuming Council supports the proposal, a Public Hearing would be scheduled. Public input can also be provided at the Hearing.</p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>In September 2011, the District of Saanich and the Capital Regional District entered an agreement that would see the long term preservation of the vast majority of lands known as Haro Woods. The site is located in the Cadboro Bay neighbourhood at 2391 and 2435 Arbutus Road. (<u><a href="http://www.saanich.ca/pdf/haro_woods.pdf" target="_blank">Media Release</a></u>).</p>
      <p>As part of this proposal, the vast majority of the parcel would be rezoned to &ldquo;Nature Park&rdquo;. In an effort to support aging infrastructure, an underground attenuation tank would be built on the area of land previously disturbed. The tank would be completely underground and the area would be back filled and covered in native plants. No fencing would be installed and the long-term use of the lands and trails would not be impacted. </p>
      <h2>Public Consultation</h2>
      <p>Drop-in Information Open Houses were held on Wednesday, February 20th between 4:00 and 8:00 p.m. and on Saturday, February, 23rd, between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.</p>
      <p>The identical information boards displayed at these Open Houses were also available to be viewed online. In addition the same survey available at the Open Houses could also be completed online.&nbsp; Comments were received up until May 17th, 2013.</p>
