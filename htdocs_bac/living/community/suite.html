      <p>Based on a focused study of the issue and consultation with citizens,
        Secondary Suites are now permitted in defined areas of Saanich,
        assuming property owners can comply with basic requirements. A map of
        areas where Secondary Suites will be considered, along with the
        requirements for a legal Secondary Suite, are outlined below. </p>
      <h2> What are the Requirements for a Secondary Suite to be
        considered Legal?</h2>
      <p> In order for a Secondary Suite to be legal, <strong>all</strong> of
        the requirements outlined below must be met. </p>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li> The property must be located within the defined area know as
          &ldquo;South of McKenzie Avenue (see map below). </li>
        <li> The property must be zoned for single family use (RS Zones only). </li>
        <li> Conditions of the relevant zone must be met (ex. maximum floor
          area/floor space ratio). </li>
        <li> The secondary suite must be wholly contained within the single
          family dwelling. Secondary Suites may not be connected to the
          house by a breezeway or enclosed hallway, they must be an integral
          part of the single family house. </li>
        <li> No more than one (1) secondary suite is permitted per lot or per
          single family dwelling. </li>
        <li> The registered owner of the property must occupy either the single
          family dwelling or the secondary suite as their principle
          residence ( a signed affidavit is required). </li>
        <li> An Occupancy Permit must be issued for the Secondary Suite from
          the Saanich Building Inspections Division, based on the relevant
          section(s) of the BC Building Code related to Secondary Suites. </li>
        <li> One (1) additional onsite-parking space for the occupant of the
          secondary suite must be provided. Tandem parking on the driveway
          is permitted. </li>
        <li> No more than two (2) kitchens are permitted per lot or per single
          family dwelling; </li>
        <li>Boarding is not permitted within the secondary suite.</li>
        <li> &ldquo;Accommodation for a Family Member&rdquo; OR a Secondary
          Suite is allowed, not both. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2> Where in Saanich will legal Secondary Suites be allowed with a
        Permit?</h2>
      <p> <strong>&nbsp;<a href="/living/community/suite/AreaWhereSSarepermitted.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="/images/living/community/suite/ss_map.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></strong></p>
      <h2> Why are legal Secondary Suites only possible in certain areas
        of Saanich?</h2>
      <p> As part of Saanich&rsquo;s 2009 Strategic Plan, Staff was tasked with
        undertaking a study within a portion of the community, to look more
        closely at the issues surrounding the potential legalization of
        secondary suites. The study area (South of McKenzie Avenue - See Map
        Above) was chosen based on the need to look at a large enough area to
        capture a broad range of neighbourhoods, residents, single family
        housing types, lot sizes, and subdivision patterns, yet a small enough
        area to be able to have more in-depth discussions with residents and
        receive detailed feedback. As noted during the review process,
        studying the issue of secondary suites and their acceptance in one
        area of Saanich does not preclude having a similar discussion and
        review process in other areas of the community. </p>
      <h2> What is the Process to make a Secondary Suite Legal?</h2>
      <h3> A.&nbsp; Existing Single
        Family Dwelling (Owner Occupied)</h3>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li> Review the requirements above to make sure you can comply with
          them; </li>
        <li> Consult with a building professional (Ex. Builder, Building
          Designer, Architect) to see what would be required to meet
          relevant BC Building Code requirements; </li>
        <li> Complete and submit a <a href="../../business/perminsp/App_Residential_RENO.pdf" target="_blank"> Building &nbsp;Permit Application for Renovation of a
          Single Family Dwelling</a>, including all the required
          attachments, the signed <a href="/business/perminsp/SecondarySuiteDeclaration.pdf" target="_blank">owner
            affidavit</a>, and permit fee. </li>
        <li> Complete and submit a <a href="../../business/perminsp/App_Residential_ADDT.pdf" target="_blank">Building
          &nbsp;Permit Application for Addition to a Single Family
          Dwelling</a>, including all the required attachments, the
          signed <a href="/business/perminsp/SecondarySuiteDeclaration.pdf" target="_blank">owner
            affidavit</a>, and permit fee. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> Building Inspection staff will review the submitted material, do the
        necessary inspections, and assuming all requirements can be met by the
        property owner, an Occupancy Permit will be issued for the Secondary
        Suite. If you sell the property in the future, the new owner would
        need to complete and sign a new affidavit confirming that they will
        occupy either the single family dwelling or the secondary suite as
        their principle residence. </p>
      <h3> B.&nbsp; New Single
        Family Dwelling (Owner Occupied)</h3>
      <p> Same as above, except you would need to complete and submit a <a href="../../business/perminsp/App_Residential_NEW_BLDG.pdf" target="_blank">Building
        Permit Application for a new Single Family Dwelling</a>,
        including all the required attachments, the signed owner affidavit,
        and permit fee. </p>
      <h3> C.&nbsp; New Single Family
        Dwelling (Occupancy Unknown / Spec. House)</h3>
      <p> Same as above, except you would need to complete and submit a <a href="../../business/perminsp/App_Residential_NEW_BLDG.pdf"
							  						target="_blank">Building Permit Application for a new Single
        Family Dwelling</a>, including all the required attachments
        and fee. The Secondary Suite would <strong>not be legal</strong> until such time that the owner submitted a signed owner affidavit
        confirming that they will occupy either the single family dwelling or
        the secondary suite as their principle residence. </p>
