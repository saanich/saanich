      <h2><a name="Prepayment"></a><a name="General"></a>General Tax Information </h2>
      <p>The District of Saanich sends annual property tax notices to all property owners. Property taxes cover the calendar year, are sent to homeowners in mid May, and are due the first business day after July 1st. </p>
      <p>Each year, the BC Assessment produces independent and uniform property assessments for all property
              owners in the province. BC Assessment provides market value information on properties within the
              District of Saanich to the municipality as the basis for calculating annual property taxes. Municipal Council uses this information to determine the annual tax rate. </p>
      <p> Saanich collects approximately $170 million each year from over 40,000 properties. Of this total
        amount, a portion is collected for other taxing authorities including the Provincial Government
        (School Taxes), Capital Regional District, Capital Regional Hospital District, Regional Transit
        Commission, BC Assessment, and the Municipal Finance Authority. The municipality has no
        control over the rates for these agencies. These taxes are paid to the specific agency, even if
        property owners do not pay their annual property taxes. </p>
      <p> Saanich properties are levied property taxes, the most important single source of municipal
        revenue, that pay for municipal services including recreation facilities, parks and trails, and
        police and fire services. These taxes are the <a href="#where">Municipal General Tax</a> portion
        of your tax notice. </p>
      <p> If your payment is received after the due date, a ten percent (10%) late payment penalty is added
        to unpaid current year taxes, including unclaimed <a href="#unclaimedhog">Home Owner Grants. </a></p>
      <p> If you have not received your property tax notice, please contact the Property Tax Department at
        250-475-5454. It is the responsibility of the property owner to pay property taxes by the due date
        to avoid penalty, regardless of whether a notice was received. </p>

      <h2><a name="prepayment"></a>Prepayment Of Property Taxes </h2>
      <p>Taxpayers may prepay their current year property taxes. Prepayment interest applies to prepayments
              made from January 1 to April 30 (or last business day in April) of the current year. Also, any
              credit amount on a tax account from the previous year is applied as a current year prepayment.
              Prepayment interest is credited to the tax account automatically. Prepayment interest is
              calculated from the date of payment to the penalty date and is credited to the tax account. The
              maximum prepayment amount allowed is the net taxes paid in the previous year. Contact the Saanich Property

      <h2><a name="howtaxed"></a>How Your Property Is Taxed</h2>
      <p>Each year, the municipality, school districts, regional district, hospital district, and other
      public agencies need revenue for the services they provide to the residents of Saanich. </p>
      <p> Each public agency with taxing authority sets a budget for the amount of tax revenue it requires.
        Tax rates vary among property classifications and are calculated by dividing the budget needs of
        the agency by its assessment base. </p>
      <p> The appropriate tax rate is then applied to individual property assessments, and the tax levy is
        calculated. Tax exemptions for some categories of property - farms, for example - are calculated
        as part of the assessment before the tax rate is applied. </p>
      <p> Municipal property tax rates are set by the District of Saanich. The revenue from these taxes is
        used for public services such as police and fire protection, street lighting, road and drainage
        maintenance and operating parks and recreational facilities. Your tax notice may also include
        local services levies calculated on a parcel basis or on the frontage of your property, rather
        than on its assessed value. </p>
      <p> School tax rates applicable to residential properties are set by the provincial government.
        Residential school taxes are based in part on the number of residences, as well as the total
        assessed value of residential property in the province, creating a different tax rate in each
        school district. </p>
      <p> School tax rates applicable to non-residential properties are also set by the provincial
        government. The rates vary by property classification, but are uniform throughout the province
        within each non-residential property class. </p>
      <p> Other taxes shown on the tax notice raise revenues on the budget needs set by local government
        bodies such as the Capital Regional District, Capital Regional Hospital District, BC Assessment
        Authority, Municipal Finance Authority and Regional Transit Commission.</p>

      <p> <strong>I haven&rsquo;t received a tax notice, what should I do?</strong><br />
        Tax notices are mailed to property owners mid May.&nbsp; If you have not received your notice,
        contact the Saanich Tax Department at 250-475-5454, or visit the office at 770 Vernon Avenue.
        Copies of Tax Notices can be mailed or faxed to home owners. </p>
      <p> <strong>I received a tax notice for my property but it&rsquo;s not in my name, what should I
        do?</strong><br />
        If your name does not appear on the tax notice but you are the registered owner and you are
        eligible for the Home Owner Grant, you may apply for the grant, but you will need your title
        number found on the Transfer of Fee Simple, or other document conveying the property to you. For
        further assistance, contact the Property Tax Department at 250-475-5454, or bring your transfer
        papers into the office. </p>
      <p> <strong>I received a tax notice for a property that I no longer own, what should I do?</strong> <br />
        If you have the information of the new owner you should forward the tax notice to them.
        Alternatively you can return it to the Property Tax Department. </p>
      <p> <strong>If I am selling my home, who should apply for the Home Owner Grant and pay the
        taxes?</strong><br />
        If you have not yet sold the property and are eligible for the grant, then you should apply for
        it. If you have already sold the property, and the new owner(s) live at the property, then the new
        owner(s) should apply for it, assuming that they have not claimed a grant for any other property
        in this calendar year. Attorneys for buyers and sellers of property normally adjust the
        purchase/sale price to account for the property taxes. If you are unable to see how the taxes were
        adjusted on your Statement of Adjustments, then you should contact the lawyer or realtor who
        closed your sale for further advisement. </p>
      <p> <strong>The property taxes were paid by the lawyer, what should I do?</strong><br />
        Ask your lawyer if you are responsible for claiming the Home Owner Grant. If you are the new owner
        and you are to apply for the grant, <a href="https://secure.saanich.ca/tempestprod/ecom/hog/login.cfm?title=Claim+Home+Owner+Grant" target="_blank">submit the
          grant application</a> to the Property Tax Department by the due date to avoid penalty. </p>
      <p> <strong>I didn&rsquo;t claim my Home Owner Grant last year, can I still claim it?</strong><br />
        The Provincial Government allows an extension of time in which to claim a grant for the prior year
        if you are the homeowner or eligible occupant and you meet all residency qualifications up to
        December 31 of that year. Retroactive grant application forms are available at the Property Tax
        Department. Documentary evidence for proof of residency may be requested. Retroactive applications
        are applicable for the preceding year only. </p>
      <p> <strong>I don&rsquo;t turn 65 until after the taxes are due, can I still claim the additional
        grant, or do I have to wait until next year?</strong><br />
        You are eligible to claim the additional grant in the calendar year that you turn 65 years of
        age. So if your birth date is after the July deadline, you are still eligible to claim the
        additional grant as long as you turn 65 during the calendar year. </p>
      <p> <strong>My spouse is away until after the tax due date, can I sign the home owner grant on his/her
        behalf?</strong><br />
        If a registered owner is unavailable to sign the Home Owners Grant, he or she may appoint a
        committee or another person providing that: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the registered owner qualifies for the grant</li>
        <li> you are in possession of a notarized power of attorney<br />
          Please note that some Power of Attorney forms, which are not provided by the Municipality,
          could be restrictive in nature and may not be applicable for purposes of claiming a grant. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> Eligible occupants may also pay their gross taxes and apply for the grant retroactively. By paying
        gross taxes, the owners can avoid any penalties on unpaid taxes. Grants can also be claimed <a href="https://secure.saanich.ca/tempestprod/ecom/hog/login.cfm?title=Claim+Home+Owner+Grant" target="_blank">electronically</a>. </p>
      <p> <strong>The property is in my name but my child is living in it, can he/she claim the
        grant?</strong><br />
        No, only the registered owner can claim a home owner grant if they are eligible. Only one grant
        can be claimed per year, even if you own multiple properties. If the child&rsquo;s name appears on
        the title then they can claim the grant if they also meet the other <a href="http://www.sbr.gov.bc.ca/individuals/property_taxes/home_owner_grant/eligibility_criteria.htm"
						target="_blank">eligibility criteria</a>. </p>
      <p> <strong>If the registered owner of a property passes away, can a home owner grant be claimed on
        their behalf?</strong><br />
        If a spouse or relative of the deceased owner is living at the property, then he/she may claim the
        grant on behalf of the owner, if the following applies: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Registered owner passed away during this calendar year<br />
          Applicant is a permanent resident of BC, occupied this residence prior to the death and
          continues to occupy this residence (proof of residency will be requested) </li>
        <li> The residence remains registered in the name of the deceased owner (or estate of deceased
          owner)<br />
          Note: If the deceased was eligible for the additional grant during this calendar year, you may
          apply for both the basic and additional grants in the year of death only. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <strong>Why am I being penalized for not claiming my grant?</strong><br />
        You can reduce the amount of taxes owing by claiming grants you are eligible for; until you claim
        your grant the total remains outstanding. Grants have to be claimed EACH year. </p>
      <p> <strong>I can&rsquo;t pay my current year&rsquo;s taxes, what should I do?</strong><br />
        Claim your home owner grant, if applicable, and send it in with a partial payment, or no payment
        before the due date. You will receive a penalty on the outstanding balance as of the penalty date
        and then there will be no more charges until January 1st, so you have some time to pay off the
        balance without further charges. On January 1st, outstanding balances are charged daily interest. </p>
      <p> <strong>If I can&rsquo;t pay my taxes will you sell my house by public auction?</strong><br />
        Properties that have current, arrears, and delinquent taxes as of the last Monday in September
        will be offered for public auction with the starting bid being the outstanding taxes. All three
        years taxes must be outstanding before the property is offered at tax sale. All properties subject
        to the tax sale must be advertised in the newspaper before the public auction occurs. You do not
        have to pay all three years worth of taxes to keep your property from being sold, but the
        delinquent taxes (the oldest) must be cleared up before the Property Tax Sale. Contact the Saanich
        Property Tax Department for further information at 250-475-5454. </p>
      <p> <strong>I pay my taxes through the pre-authorized payment plan; do I need to do anything
        else?</strong><br />
        You need to claim your home owner grant if eligible. No withdrawals are taken from your account in
        June or July. If your tax notice shows a balance, you need to pay the amount owing before the due
        date. <strong>Any outstanding balance after the first business day in July will be subject to a
          10% penalty.</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>Can I access my property tax information online?</strong><br />
        Yes, you are able to access your assessment and gross tax levy online through <a href="https://secure.saanich.ca/tempestprod/mycity/secure/login.cfm" target="_blank">My
          Saanich.</a></p>
      <p> <strong>What are the penalties for not paying my taxes on time?</strong><br />
        If property taxes are not paid by the due date, a 10% penalty charge will be added to the amount
        owing (including amounts owing for unclaimed Home Owner Grants). </p>
      <p> Example, if the total outstanding taxes are $1,000, the penalty charged is $100, so the balance
        due would then be $1,100. Saanich has no authority to either waive nor modify these penalty
        amounts. A payment that is one day late is subjected to the same penalty as a payment of taxes six
        months after the due date. It is a requirement of the <a href="http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/03026_00"
						target="_blank">Community Charter</a> that these penalties be added. </p>
      <p> <strong>Where can I get information and an application to defer my taxes?</strong><br />
        You can obtain a deferment application from the Saanich Tax office or you can visit the <a href="http://www.sbr.gov.bc.ca/individuals/Property_Taxes/Property_Tax_Deferment/ptd.htm"
		                target="_blank">Deferment Website</a>. For more information, please call the Saanich Tax
        Department at 250-475-5454 or the Deferment Office at 250-387-0555. </p>
      <p> <strong>When should I submit my deferment application?</strong><br />
        When you receive your tax notice in mid May you should claim your Home Owner Grant, pay your
        refuse charge if applicable, and submit your completed deferment application to the Saanich Tax
        office. Click <a href="http://www.sbr.gov.bc.ca/individuals/Property_Taxes/Property_Tax_Deferment/ptd.htm"
						target="_blank">here</a> for more information on the provincial deferment program. </p>
      <p> <strong>What types of homes qualify for tax deferment?</strong><br />
        You may defer your taxes on your home where you live and conduct your daily activities. Second
        residences such as summer cottages and rental properties do not qualify for tax deferment
        benefits. </p>
      <p> <strong>What happens if my deferment application is denied?</strong><br />
        You must pay late payment penalty charges if you are found ineligible for the program after the
        property tax due date. A 10% penalty will be applied to any outstanding balances on your account. </p>
      <p> <strong>How long can I defer my property taxes?</strong><br />
        You can defer your taxes as long as you own and live in your home and continue to qualify for the
        program. The deferred taxes must be fully repaid with interest </p>
      <ul>
        <li> before your home can be legally transferred to a new owner, other than directly to your
          surviving spouse, or </li>
        <li>upon the death of the agreement holder(s)</li>
      </ul>
      <p> If you refinance your home, your mortgage holder may require full repayment of the deferred taxes
        upon refinancing. You may repay all or part of the deferred taxes, fees, and interest at any time
        without penalty. </p>
      <p> <strong>What is the First Time Home Buyers&rsquo; Grant (PTT &ndash; Property Transfer Tax) and
        what do I have to do to get it? Is this the same program as the Provincial Home Owner
        Grant?</strong><br />
        You pay property transfer tax each time that you register a property at the Land Title Office. If
        you are purchasing your first home, you may qualify for an exemption from property transfer tax.
        Find out more about the <a href="http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/initiative/first-time-home-buyers-tax-credit"
                        target="_blank">First Time Home Buyers Grant</a>.</p>
      <p> The Provincial Home Owner Grant is <u>not</u> the same grant. The Home Owner Grant is available to
        all eligible home owners every taxation year. A grant application must be submitted annually to
        the municipality to verify eligibility in order for the grant to be applied to your tax account. </p>
      <p> <strong>What is a permissive tax exemption and how do I qualify for it?</strong><br />
        The Community Charter gives Council the authority to exempt certain land and/or improvements from
        municipal property taxes. Municipal Council will consider Permissive Tax Exemptions for certain
        non-profit organizations. For more information phone 250-475-5454. </p>
      <p> <strong>I received a property assessment, but I think the value is too high. What do I
        do?</strong><br />
        You can appeal your property tax assessment with <a href="http://www.bcassessment.ca/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">BC Assessment
          </a> 102 3350 Douglas Street, Victoria BC V8Z 7X9, telephone 479-7131. You must contact
        BC Assessment  for information on the appeal process, the municipality is not
        responsible for values assigned to your property, and therefore has no authority to make changes
        to your annual assessment. </p>
      <p> <strong>I think that my taxes are too high, can I appeal them?</strong><br />
        Each year the tax rates are set by Municipal Council and other taxing authorities in May. They are
        based on their respective budgets and the total Municipal Assessment. All residential properties
        in Saanich are taxed with the same tax rate. If you would like to appeal your assessment, click <a href="http://www.bcassessment.ca/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">here</a> for more information. </p>
      <p> <strong>I sent my tax payment in, why haven&rsquo;t I received a receipt showing my account is
        paid?</strong><br />
        The municipality no longer automatically sends a receipt for all property tax payments. If you
        require a receipt, please include a request for one with your payment, or contact the Property
        Tax Department by phone at 250-475-5454. </p>
      <p> <strong>Why are there utility charges on my tax notice?</strong><br />
        Unpaid utility charges that are overdue at the end of the
        year are transferred to your tax account, based on the<a href="http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/03026_00"> Community Charter</a>. For more information on your utility
        charges, contact the Utility Department at 250-475-5445,
        or come to the second floor at 770 Vernon Ave. </p>
      <p> <strong>My spouse and I jointly own our property with our
        children. Why are you sending more than one tax notice
        out?</strong><br />
        Only two names are included on each tax notice. If more than
        two names appear on title, the Municipality must send out
        more than one notice to ensure that all property owners are
        notified of outstanding taxes. </p>
      <p> <strong>How do I decide where my principle residence is?</strong><br />
        It is up to the taxpayer to determine where their principle
        residence is located. Guidelines can be found <a
									   href="http://www.sbr.gov.bc.ca/individuals/Property_Taxes/Home_Owner_Grant/eligibility_criteria.htm"
									   target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
      <p>Summer cottages, rental properties, and second homes do not
        qualify for home owner grants.</p>
      <p> <strong>What is the tax year; July to July or the calendar
        year?</strong><br />
        The tax year runs for the calendar year, January 1-December
        31. </p>
      <p> <strong>I have applied for my grant, when will I receive
        my rebate?</strong><br />
        Rebates are not issued. If you have applied for a grant,
        your gross taxes have been reduced based on the amount of
        the grant claimed. </p>

      <h2><a name="penalties" id="penalties"></a>Penalties</h2>
      <p>If property taxes are not paid by the due date, a 10% penalty
              charge will be added to the amount owing (including amounts

      <p> Example, if the total outstanding taxes are $1,000, the
        penalty charged is $100, so the balance due would then be

        these penalty amounts. A payment that is one day late is
        subjected to the same penalty as a payment of taxes six months
        after the due date. It is a requirement of the Local Government
        Act that these penalties be added. </p>
