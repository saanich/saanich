      <p>The Property Tax Pre-Authorized Payment Plan is an optional
        payment plan towards <strong>next year's taxes.</strong>&nbsp; This program provides an opportunity for taxpayers
        to make ten (10) equal monthly payments for property taxes.
        You may enrol in this program at any time; payments run August
        to May inclusive and are withdrawn on the first business
        day of each of the ten months. The payments can be made any
        time by authorizing automatic transfer of payments from a
        chequing account at any Canadian financial institution to
        your property tax account with the District of Saanich.</p>
      <p class="highlight-box">If the property is changing ownership and is on the
        Tax Pre-authorized Payment Plan, monthly withdrawals will
        continue until the property owner notifies the Property
        Tax Department to cancel the payments.&nbsp; It is your
        responsibility to ensure that the conveyancing lawyer
        or notary provides you with a full credit on your statement
        of adjustments.</p>

          time of application. Changes to the monthly payment will
        be indicated on your annual property tax notice.</li>
