      <p>On August 30, 2000, new legislation came into
        force in British Columbia that allows quick action to be
        taken to protect people and animals from dangerous dogs.
        A dangerous dog is one that has killed or seriously injured,
        or is likely to kill or seriously injure, a person. A dog
        is also dangerous if it has killed or seriously injured a
        domestic animal in a public place or while on private property
        other than the dog owner's property.</p>
      <p>The new law respects the rights of responsible dog owners
        who make sure their pets are property cared for, well socialized,
        trained and do not pose a threat. The law deals with situations
        where irresponsible dog owners who, even when faced with
        evidence that their dog is dangerous, refuse to take the
        necessary measures to prevent a dog attack.</p>
      <p>When an incident concerning a dog occurs, an animal control
        officer will assess each case on an individual basis. If
        the officer believes the dog is dangerous and the owner of
        the dog refuses to give the dog up to the authorities, the
        officer may obtain a warrant to seize the dog from private
        property. Once a dog has been seized, it may be impounded
        pending a provincial court order of destruction.</p>
      <p>The animal control officer must be able to convince a justice
        of the peace that there are reasonable grounds for the dangerous
        dog assessment and that a warrant should be issued for the
        seizure and impoundment of the dog. In an application for
        a provincial court order, the judge must be convinced that
        the destruction of the animal is in the public interest.
        The dog owner would have the opportunity to be heard by the
        judge.</p>
      <p><strong>All dogs can bite.</strong> A dog may show aggression
        when protecting its young, its owner, its owner's property,
        its food or its toys. A dog may bite or growl if it is injured,
        frightened or threatened. This does not mean that all dogs
        are necessarily dangerous.</p>
      <p>Steps to take if your dog shows signs of inappropriate aggression:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> First, talk to your veterinarian. Your veterinarian
          can help with advice and, if appropriate, medical intervention.
          It is important to establish a relationship with your
          veterinarian through regular veterinary examinations to
          check that your dog is healthy and is pain-free.</li>
        <li> Make sure that your dog is kept in a secured environments
          - a fenced yard or locked enclosure (your local animal
          control office or SPCA branch can provide you with guidelines
          on space, fencing and tethering). Make sure your property
          is well marked, warning people that a potentially dangerous
          dog is present. Never leave children unattended with any
          dog.</li>
        <li> When you take the dog off your property, make sure the
          dog is leashed and, if appropriate, muzzled. Some local
          governments have bylaws requiring the muzzling and/or
          leashing of dogs in public places. Keep your dog well
          away from other pedestrians and pets.</li>
        <li> Consult with a reputable dog trainer or dog behaviour
          specialist. The younger the dog is when training begins,
          the more successful the outcome. All dog owners are encouraged
          to socialize their young dogs by attending puppy-training
          sessions before a problem with aggressiveness arises.</li>
        <li> Have your dog spayed or neutered. Sterilizing your dog
          can significantly reduce aggressive behaviour.</li>
        <li> As the owner, if you feel that your dog's aggressive
          behaviour cannot be controlled and the risk of injury
          to a person or animal is too great, you should have your
          dog euthanized.        </li>
      </ul>
