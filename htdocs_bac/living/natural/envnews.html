    <h2>Rivers Day 2012</h2>
    <p>In November 2011, Swan Creek, which is part of the Colquitz River watershed, experienced a furnace oil spill from a private property. &nbsp;The spill caused downstream pollution and the death of some of the returning coho salmon.&nbsp; Since then, the District has been engaged in clean-up and recovery efforts on Swan Creek and Colquitz River and is pleased to announce that recent biological surveys have discovered coho fry in abundant numbers downstream of the site of the oil spill.</p>
    <p>During a Saanich Engineering sewer line repair project this summer, fish were trapped and relocated in order to make the site safe for work.&nbsp; The biologist conducting the work for Saanich caught over 200 Coho Salmon fry, 24 Cutthroat Trout and 42 crayfish.&nbsp; Aquatic invertebrates such as crayfish are indicative of a productive ecosystem capable of supporting fish populations.&nbsp; These fish were all located downstream of the 2011 oil spill site.&nbsp; The project continues this fall, with bioengineering techniques to re-vegetate and stabilize the creek banks with native plants and an instream project to create a riffle structure.</p>
    <p>The District is working with biologist Ian Bruce this fall in a remediation effort to improve habitat in Swan Creek to create additional spawning habitat where salmon were observed last November during the oil spill.&nbsp; As well as this work within the stream, the stream banks will be cleared of invasive species and planted with native trees and shrubs this fall in order to provide shade, cover and food for the emerging salmon fry next spring.&nbsp; As part of this project, a new stewardship group will be formed.&nbsp; For more information, please <a href="http://peninsulastreams.ca/archives/swan-creek-restoration-and-stewardship">visit the website</a>.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Saanich is also undertaking a campaign this fall, in cooperation with several home heating oil service providers, to inform residents about the proper maintenance and replacement of furnace oil tanks.&nbsp; It is hoped that by providing this information, in the form of a <strong><a href="../environment/pdf/OilTanks2012.pdf">brochure</a></strong>, to residents, future spills can be prevented.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>This September 30, BC will be celebrating <strong><a href="http://commons.bcit.ca/riversday/">Rivers Day 2012</a></strong>.&nbsp; Rivers Day is a day of recognition and celebration of all things related to watersheds and river life.&nbsp; The District of Saanich joins with all British Columbians to acknowledge the importance of rivers to healthy ecosystems and will continue to protect and preserve Saanich&rsquo;s streams for future generations.&nbsp;</p>
