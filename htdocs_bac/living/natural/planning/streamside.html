      <p>The Streamside Development Permit Area (SDPA) was adopted by the District of Saanich in 2006
        to comply with the Riparian Areas Regulation (RAR) of the provincial Fish Protection Act. The
        RAR directs local governments to protect the land adjacent to streams that directly or
        indirectly support fish.  The two main purposes of the SPDA are: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>To protect the land adjacent to streams from new development.</li>
        <li> To direct the restoration of streamside areas so that they support fish and provide
          biologically diverse wildlife habitat and corridors for wildlife movement. </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>When is a Streamside Development Permit needed?</h2>
      <p> The alteration of land, subdivision and construction are prohibited within an environmental
        development permit area unless an exemption applies or a development permit is issued. If
        there is a creek, stream or wetland on your property, you will likely need to apply for a
        Streamside Development Permit in order to develop. The Streamside Development Permit Areas
        Atlas is available for viewing at the Planning Department counter. The atlas indicates the
        watercourses and wetlands where a streamside development permit area exists. </p>

      <h2>Where can I get more information?</h2>
      <p> Please contact <a href="mailto:Adriane.Pollard@saanich.ca">Environmental Services</a> at the
        District of Saanich Planning Department to discuss site specific circumstances and to
        determine if a Streamside Development Permit is required. </p>
      <h2>What is a Qualified Environmental Professional (QEP)?</h2>
      <p> For most applications a Qualified Environmental Professional may be required to provide a
        report and/or recommendations to enhance or protect the stream.  Simply put, a QEP is an
        individual who is a member in good standing of a British Columbia professional association
        (such as, but not limited to; a Biologist, Engineer, Agrologist, Technologist or Forester),
        and has the knowledge and work experience to complete a scientific review of the site
        conditions in and about a water body that may support fish resources. </p>

      <h2>What should I plant near a stream?</h2>
      <p> Restoration is often a requirement for developing within a Streamside Development Permit
        Area. There are many beautiful native plants suitable for planting along a streambank or
        wetland area in Saanich. </p>
      <p> Native vegetation provides habitat and food for wildlife, holds soil in place, prevents
        erosion, and filters out pollution that could contaminate waterways. Native plants are also
        adapted to our climate and environment, are naturally resistant to local pests and diseases
        and, once established, require no watering and little maintenance. </p>
