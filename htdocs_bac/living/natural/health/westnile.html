      <p>West Nile Virus is spread to people by a few different species of mosquitoes only after they have fed on the blood of infected birds. It first appeared in North America in 1999. In Canada, the virus has been found in Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. While West Nile Virus has been detected in the past in British Columbia and Washington, the Provincial Government has indicated there is little risk in Victoria and has discontinued its preparedness program in the region. </p>
      <p>Where it occurs, the risk of contracting West Nile Virus is highest during the mosquito season (mid-April through September); however the risk of becoming infected is very low. Most people who contract West Nile Virus show no symptoms at all, while 20% will develop flu-like symptoms, and, in very rare cases (1%), the virus can cause severe illness. The best way to protect yourself and your family is to avoid mosquito bites if you are in a region where West Nile has been reported.</p>
      <h2>Saanich Response</h2>
      <p>Saanich has a West Nile Virus Response Plan which is based on several years of inventory and monitoring.&nbsp; If the Provincial government directs municipalities to take action, Saanich is prepared.</p>
      <p> One of the main actions that Saanich can take in the event of an outbreak is to manage catch basins.&nbsp; Catch basins are located next to the curb or edge of roads.&nbsp; Their purpose is to collect rain water, allow sediments to settle out, and direct the rain water to the nearest body of water.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under certain conditions, catch basins can become mosquito breeding habitat. </p>
      <p>In the absence of West Nile Virus, Saanich does not actively control mosquito populations, but we do keep a list of problem areas to address in the event of an outbreak of West Nile Virus.&nbsp; There are many factors that can cause mosquito populations to fluctuate.&nbsp; Saanich will investigate&nbsp;mosquito breeding grounds is to see if there is a drainage problem that can be addressed without harming the environment.&nbsp; Saanich continues to improve habitat for predators of mosquitoes and their larvae in&nbsp;natural areas.      </p>
      <h2>Suggestions to protect yourself</h2>
      <p>Many of the mosquitoes around us come from small sources of standing water around the home, and some mosquitoes even breed in the upper intertidal areas along our coast, so preventing mosquitoes from biting you is the most effective strategy.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid the outdoors at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active.</li>
        <li>Protect yourself by wearing clothing to cover your arms and legs and wear a hat.</li>
        <li>Wear light coloured clothes because mosquitoes are attracted to dark clothing.</li>
        <li> Ensure door and window screens are effective in keeping mosquitoes outdoors.</li>
        <li>Use insect repellents when outdoors. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Reduce mosquito breeding areas around your home<a name="home"></a></h2>
      <p>You can search for evidence of breeding mosquitoes, as the larvae are very easy to spot. Look for small 
        aquatic insects (&lsquo;wrigglers&rsquo;) that suspend themselves at the surface of water and wiggle below if you disturb them.</p>
      <p>Mosquitoes require standing water to lay their eggs in, and under ideal conditions, some mosquitoes can develop into adults in less than a week.&nbsp; Even a small amount of standing water can provide breeding areas.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Empty standing water from things such as pool covers, saucers under gardening pots, buckets, recycling bins and garbage cans. </li>
        <li>Clear your property of unused items that could collect water (such as old tires). </li>
        <li>Change water twice a week in items such as bird baths, pet bowls, wading pools and livestock watering tanks. </li>
        <li>Use screens to cover rain barrels. </li>
        <li>Clean eave troughs regularly to avoid standing water. </li>
        <li>Do not overwater lawns or wash cars in driveway - the water goes into the catch basins on your street, providing breeding habitat. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What do I do if I have a pond?<a name="ponds"></a></h2>
      <p>A healthy wetland with native aquatic plants and insects will produce very few mosquitoes, so nothing should be done that may upset the balance.&nbsp; Problem mosquitoes may be coming from many sources, so be sure to first check your ponds for the tell-tale larvae. &nbsp;If you have a small pond, or a pond that is not a balanced ecosystem, there are still a few options available.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Encourage your ponds to reach a natural state of balance by planting native plants. </li>
        <li>To manually remove mosquito larvae use a small gauge aquarium net to scoop the wriggling insects at the water&rsquo;s surface</li>
        <li>Temporarily drain the water source, but remember that mosquitoes are very quick to re-colonize an area.</li>
        <li>Install an aerator or pump that will keep the surface water moving, making the pond unsuitable for egg-laying by mosquitoes and unwelcoming to mosquito larvae. </li>
        <li>Attract mosquito predators to your yard such as bats, swallows, or dragonflies. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your wetland is natural, or is connected to a natural waterway such as a creek or lake, it is illegal to put fish in it. Be sure to contact the proper authorities for advice before introducing fish.</p>
      <h2>Can I use pesticides?<a name="pesticides"></a></h2>
      <p class="float-left"><img src="../../../images/living/env/nile/larvae-picture_1_001.gif" alt=""><br>
      Larvae - Culex Environmental Ltd</p>
      <p>For the health of the environment and your family, pesticide use is not recommended. Using a pesticide of any type in a pond or wetland disrupts the normal balance of predators and prey (the web of life), so it should not be used in healthy ecosystems.</p>
      <p>Concerns over the use of pesticides are that they effect non-target organisms, and can possibly create new, and sometimes more-hospitable, breeding habitat. Mosquitoes may also develop a resistance to the pesticides in use.&nbsp; Pesticide control for mosquitoes targets the immature life-stages, which are confined to water. Commercial pesticides can only be applied by certified pesticide applicators. </p>
      <p>If you find water containing mosquito larvae on your property, and you have tried all the tips above, there is a pesticide option for the homeowner.&nbsp; Biological larvicides are available from your local home-and-garden centre. These contain naturally occurring bacteria called <em>Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis</em> (Bti) which target all species of aquatic flies. Fully 10% of all flies are aquatic in their larval stage, and many of them are food for other animals such as dragonflies, birds, amphibians, fish and bats. Some flies are even predators of mosquitoes.</p>
      <h2>What is Bti?<a name="bti"></a></h2>
      <p><em>Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis</em> (Bti) is a naturally occurring soil bacterium that is being applied as a biological pest control agent to areas of standing water where mosquitoes breed. Bti produces a protein crystal that, once ingested by the feeding larvae, kills all flies by damaging their digestive system so that they can&rsquo;t feed and they die within days. Bti has been used since 1982, and Health Canada has determined that it poses little threat to human health, and it only affects aquatic flies.</p>
      <p>The weight of scientific evidence indicates that Bti is non-infectious and non-toxic to humans and other mammals, and poses little risk at dosage levels permitted in insect control programs. It should be noted however, that mosquitoes can develop resistance to it over time, and when used on a healthy wetland ecosystem the effect can be the opposite of what you would like by creating a predator-free environment that new mosquitoes can colonize. As with all pesticides, Bti should be used with caution.</p>
