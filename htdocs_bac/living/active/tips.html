      <h2>Back to School and Keeping Families Healthy and Active</h2>
      <p>
        Fall is approaching and kids will be returning back to school. Everyone's schedules are
        changing and you are wondering how to keep active in the transition for both you and your
        children. Here are a few tips that may help.</p>
      <h2> Encourage a Good Night's Sleep</h2>
      <p>
        The summer sleep in is almost over. It is important to start changing sleeping schedules and
        set reasonable bedtimes so the kids will be well-rested and ready to learn every morning. The
        average child needs at least 9 to 10 hours or more of sleep each night, and more when they are
      ill.</p>
      <h2> Walk/cycle with the kids to school</h2>
      <p>
        If you're within walking or cycling range of your child's school or activities, join them on
        their travels. Hop on your bike or walk with them to school! This way, you all get extra
      family time and your heart gets a workout too!</p>
      <h2> Schedule your Activities</h2>
      <p>
        Now that the summer is coming to a close and holidays are ending, free time may also be more
        difficult to find. Schedule your exercises and activities so you know when and what you will
      be doing. Just because summer is over, doesn't mean your workouts have to be!</p>
      <h2> Promote Habitual Hand Washing</h2>
      <p>
        The most effective thing anyone can do to keep from getting sick is to wash their hands. Kids
        are constantly exposed to germs, so they need to be diligent and habitual about washing their
        hands frequently. Kids can also keep a dispenser of antimicrobial hand rinse in their desk or
        backpack to use before lunch or throughout the day, in addition to washing. Fighting germs
      helps them stay healthy all year long.</p>
