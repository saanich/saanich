      <p><strong>The <em>Social Well-Being</em></strong>section of <strong>Saanich&rsquo;s Official Community Plan </strong>promotes community values such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Protection of agricultural land for current and future generations;</li>
        <li>Access to safe and nutritious food supply, at a reasonable cost; and</li>
        <li>Opportunities for food production in both rural and urban areas</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In general, the Official Community Plan polices connected to Agriculture and Food Security support initiatives to ensure a healthy, sustainable, and stable food supply within the region; protect the Agricultural Land Reserve; develop appropriate regulations and guidelines for future rural and urban farming; encourage innovative farming and local marketing; improve soil capabilities; and encourage environmentally sound agricultural practices.&nbsp; See the Saanich Official Community Plan, <em><a href="http://www.saanich.ca/living/community/ocp/ocp_adopted_jul808_amended_may1710.pdf#page=51" target="_blank">Section 5.1.1</a></em> Agriculture and Food Security for more detail on approved long-term policy.</p>
      <h2>Zoning Bylaw <a name="zoning"></a></h2>
      <p>The A-1 and A-4 Rural Zones cover the most parcels in Rural Saanich and include agricultural use and produce sales of items produced on the property in the list of permitted uses.&nbsp; Over the years a few rural zones have been created that addressed special agricultural land use.&nbsp; These zones include the A-3&nbsp; Farm Market Zone and the A-2 Rural zone which permits 2 dwellings on one parcel.&nbsp; The&nbsp; C-18 Rural Commercial zone &nbsp; was created to recognize the activities required for the sale and distribution of local agricultural products to the community.&nbsp; The processing of food is permitted in&nbsp; the M-5 Zone but not Rural Zones. Food processing and warehousing use is a consideration that affects local food supply and distribution.&nbsp; Food processing and warehousing is permitted within the M-5 Industrial Zones in Saanich.&nbsp; Warehousing use is also permitted in most Industrial Zones and some Commercial Zones.</p>

      <p><em><strong> Farm Protection</strong></em></p>
      <p>Agricultural Land Reserve Between 1974 and 1976 the Province of BC established a special land use zone called the "<a href="http://www.alc.gov.bc.ca/alr/alr_main.htm" target="_blank">Agricultural Land Reserve</a>"&nbsp;to protect BC's supply of agricultural land.&nbsp; Agriculture is recognized as the priority use in the Agricultural Land Reserve and non-agricultural uses are controlled by a set of policies and regulations outlined in the Agricultural Land Reserve Act. </p>
      <p>The Farm Protection (<a href="http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96131_01" target="_blank">Right to Farm</a>) Act&nbsp;ensures that farmers are able to use "normal farm practices"&nbsp;within the Agricultural Land Reserve by protecting them from nuisance lawsuits, nuisance bylaws and prohibitive injunctions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/living/afs/foodprocessing.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p>The BC Ministry of Agriculture provides a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.agf.gov.bc.ca/resmgmt/fppa/refguide/activity/870218-50_Product_Processing.pdf" target="_blank">Product Processing Fact Sheet</a>&rdquo;</p>
      <p><strong><em>Animals:</em></strong></p>
      <p>Slaughtering and processing of animals for human consumption is regulated by the <a href="http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/anima/animae.shtml" target="_blank">Canadian Food Inspection Agency</a> and the BC Ministry of Health through the BC Food Safety Act and the <a href="http://www.health.gov.bc.ca/protect/meat-regulation/regulation_description.html" target="_blank">Meat Inspection Regulations</a> (MIT).</p>
      <p>New Meat Inspection Regulations for the Province of BC came into effect September 1, 2004 for new operations and September 1, 2006 for existing slaughter operations in response to disease out breaks such as the <em>bovine spongiform encephalopathy</em> crises.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Under the new legislation, all animals killed for human consumption in BC must be slaughtered in a provincial or federally licensed facility, in the presence of a certified meat inspector.&nbsp; Inspection services are provided by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, on contract to the Province.&nbsp;      
      <p><img src="../../images/living/afs/abbattoir.jpg" alt="" class="float-right">There are seven licensed abattoirs operating on southern Vancouver Island.&nbsp; Six small scale abattoirs are located north of the Malahat and one is located in Metchosin.&nbsp; The capacity of the Island abattoirs is limited.&nbsp; Large volume slaughterhouses are located on the mainland which increases the cost to large volume farms.</p>
                  <p><strong><em>Vegetable &amp; Fruit Processing</em></strong>:</p>
                  <p>The processing of fruits and vegetables is regulated by the <a href="http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/imp/guide2e.shtml" target="_blank">Canada Agricultural Products Ac</a>t  and the BC Ministry of Agriculture through the <em><a href="http://www.agf.gov.bc.ca/ministry/legsum/APGR.stm" target="_blank">Agricultural Produce Grading Act</a>.</em></p>
                  <p>The Ministry of Agriculture prepared a <a href="http://www.agf.gov.bc.ca/fieldvegetable/publications/documents/field_veg_profile.pdf" target="_blank">Fact Sheet</a> overview of the BC Field Vegetable Industry.</p>

                  <p><strong><em>Fresh Vegetables&nbsp; </em></strong></p>
                  <p>Fresh (non-storage) field vegetables are unregulated, with the exception of iceberg and fancy lettuces produced on Vancouver Island.&nbsp; Product may be sold through brokers or direct to wholesalers and retailers; through direct market outlets such as roadside stands and farmer&rsquo;s markets; or, where allowed by Municipal Zoning, through on-farm sales.&nbsp; A farmer may also wish to combined the on-farm sales with numerous value added sales, and agri-tourism concepts where permitted (see <a href="/business/zoning/zoningbylaw.html" target="_blank">Zoning Bylaw 8200</a> and agricultural land use regulations). </p>
                  <p>Information and an example for preparing a <a href="http://www.agf.gov.bc.ca/busmgmt/bus_guides/direct_guide.htm" target="_blank">direct farm marketing plan</a> is also available on their website.</p>
                  <p>Details on direct farm marketing are available through the <a href="http://www.agf.gov.bc.ca/resmgmt/fppa/refguide/activity/870218-32_Direct_Farm_Marketing.pdf" target="_blank">BC Ministry of Agriculture</a> website.</p>
                  <p><strong><em>Storage &amp; Processing of Vegetables</em></strong></p>
                  <p>The <a href="http://www.bcveg.com/" target="_blank">BC Vegetable Marketing Commission</a> (BCVMC ) administers the <em>Natural Products Marketing (BC) Act</em> that regulates high volume storage vegetable crops within Vancouver Island and Gulf Islands.&nbsp; A quota is required and producers of high volume regulated crops are required to register annually and provide their production intentions with the Vegetable Marketing Commission.&nbsp; Regulated crops include greenhouse vegetable crops, processing vegetable crops and storage crops.</p>
                  <p><strong><em>Farm Markets:</em></strong></p>
                  <p>Currently, Farm Markets are only permitted in the <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/living/pdf/zone8200.pdf#page=69" target="_blank">A3 Rural Zone</a> (Farm Market) of Saanich Zoning Bylaw. </p>
