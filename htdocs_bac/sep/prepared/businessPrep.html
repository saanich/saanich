      <p><img src="../image/businessphoto.jpg" alt="Business People" class="float-right"> In our everyday lives, large-scale emergencies and disasters seem like a remote possibility. But the truth is that
        natural disasters such as  technological or environmental accidents, or service disruptions such as power failures
        can happen anywhere at any time. In the event of a natural or man-made disaster the District of Saanich is
        prepared. </p>
      <p> But while the District of Saanich is focused on delivering essential services, you need to be ready to protect
        your employees, assets and operations. Small businesses are especially vulnerable. As a small business owner, you
        are much more vulnerable than the larger organizations. If your site is inaccessible, you do not have multiple
        locations to act as backup sites for doing business. Do you have a business continuity plan on how you would
        carry on, during or after a major incident? If there is no tested plan in place, up to 86% of small/medium-sized
        businesses fail within 3 years of a major incident. Do you want to be part of that statistic? </p>
      <p> Readiness can be as simple as having an emergency preparedness plan, setting up procedures to help your business
        recover and having emergency supplies on hand. Knowing what to do when a disaster strikes will help you better
        control the situation and be in a better position to recover more quickly. </p>
      <p> The Saanich Emergency Program can provide presentations and resource information to Saanich businesses. Please
        contact the Saanich Emergency Program for more information. </p>
