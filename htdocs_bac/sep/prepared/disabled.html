      <h2><img src="../image/j0407497.jpg" alt="Man in Wheelchair Playing Tenis" class="float-right"> Plan and Prepare</h2>
      <p>        Develop a "buddy" system with your family, friends, neighbours, and co-workers. Plan how to help each other in an
        emergency. If you live alone, you may want to give your buddy a key to your home. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Make a list of your medications and allergies; special equipment; names, addresses and phone numbers of your
          doctor, pharmacy, family members and friends; and any other important information. Give a copy to each buddy
        and keep a copy with you at all times.</li>
        <li> If you rely on any life sustaining equipment/apparatus, develop an emergency backup plan that will ensure the
          equipment/apparatus works in the event of a power outage.</br>
          </br>
        </li>
        <li> Anchor items such as medical equipment, heavy appliances, bookcases, and hanging plants. Place heavy objects
          on low shelves. Move beds away from heavy picture frames and windows.</li>
        <li> Remove barriers such as bookcases which may block your safe exit after an earthquake. Install security night
          lights to provide emergency lighting if the power goes off.</li>
        <li> Make a 7 day emergency supply kit.  Make a first-aid kit, with extra medicine and a pair of glasses. Store
          extra batteries for battery-operated equipment such as hearing aides and wheelchairs. Keep a mini-survival kit
          in your car.</li>
        <li> If you require continued service from a specific service provider during an emergency, ask them if they have an
          emergency or business continuity plan.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2> Special Tips </h2>
      <ul>
        <li> If you are hearing impaired, keep a battery-operated television for receiving emergency information if the
          power is out. Store a flashlight, pencil, and pad for communicating. Arrange for hearing friends or co-workers
          to relay emergency information that is broadcast on the radio.</li>
        <li> If you are vision impaired, keep extra canes around your home. Plan alternate evacuation routes from home and
          office. Store extra food and supplies for your guide dog.</li>
        <li> If you use a wheelchair, tie a lightweight drawstring bag to it where you can keep medicines, sanitary aides,
          a small flashlight, and a horn to signal for help. Find two useable exits from each room and from your
          building. Participate in earthquake drills, moving to cover, if possible, locking the wheels, and protecting
          your head with your arms, a pillow, lap robe, books, or any handy object.</li>
      </ul>
