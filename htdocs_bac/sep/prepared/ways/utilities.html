      <h2>Electrical</h2>
      <p>Electrical power is like breathing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You usually don't think about it until it is missing.</li>
        <li>Power is just "there" ...constantly meeting your every need.</li>
        <li> It is only during a power failure (when you walk into a dark room and
          instinctively hit the useless light switch) that you realize how dependent
          we are on electricty.</li>
        <li> A potential disaster for some, a minor inconvenience for those who are
          prepared.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>        After any disaster or emergency, we will want to keep our power on.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>However, in some cases, we may have to turn it off.</li>
        <li>Most people know the location of their main electrical panel;</li>
        <ul>
          <li>they are often located in the basement or utility room.</li>
          <li> make sure everyone in your household knows where it is and how to turn
            it off.</li>
          <li> it is a good idea to tag your electrical panel for quick identification
            in the event of an emergency.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Consider one more step</strong>, turning off individual breakers. Then, when power
        is restored, you can control the turning on of your appliances, lights etc. This
        will reduce the load on the system when the power does come back on. </p>
      <p> When turning electrical power "off" or "on" at the electrical panels,
        always stand to one side, facing away from the panel, just in case there are
        electrical sparks or flashes.      </p>
      <h2>Natural Gas</h2>
      <p> After any disaster, we can expect to have a disruption, or lose, our ultility
        services.  What tends to worry people the most is a natural gas leak. </p>
      <p> Natural gas heats our homes, our water - and for some of us, our stoves and
        other appliances.  Like most fuels, natural gas is safe when properly used.
        However, accidents and emergencies can happen. </p>
      <p> It&rsquo;s important for everyone to know about natural gas safety </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>how</strong> to detect a gas leak</li>
        <li><strong>what</strong> to do in an emergency situation</li>
        <li><strong>where</strong> a gas shut off valve is</li>
        <li><strong>what</strong> not to do in an emergency situation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>      Exit your home immediately, leaving windows and doors open behind you </p>
      <ul>
        <li> turn off the gas at the meter outside only if you don&rsquo;t put yourself at risk
          by doing so;</li>
        <ul>
          <li> natural gas is 40% lighter than air and will dissipate through open
            windows and doors</li>
        </ul>
        <li>go to a neighbour&rsquo;s home and call Terasen</li>
        <li> to turn off the natural gas supply to your home take your wrench and turn the gas
          valve &frac14; turn to the right - or left</li>
        <ul>
          <li> Once the gas valve is turned to the "OFF" position you should not turn it
            back "ON".</li>
          <li> Only a qualified gas fitter should repair the system and then re-activate the gas supply.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Most of us do not know enough about our gas system to re-activate the system safely.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h2>Water Shut Off</h2>
      <p>Another service you may also need to shut off is your inside water shut off valve:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>if there is an inside water leak or burst pipe</li>
        <li>if you are evacuating for the long term</li>
        <li>if you are  advised to by emergency officials</li>
      </ul>
      <p>        The water shut off valve controls the water <strong>inside</strong> your home or building.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>easy to do;</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Turn the valve to the right.</li>
          <li>It's already in the "ON" position so you can't go wrong.</li>
          <li>Once "OFF" water won&rsquo;t come out of your taps.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>        The inside water shut off valve;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>may be in the basement,</li>
        <li>on the main floor,</li>
        <li>or in the garage.</li>
        <li>You will have to look around for it.</li>
        <li>Make sure that everyone in your household knows where it is and how to turn it off.</li>
        <li>Tag your water shut off for quick identification in the event of an emergency.</li>
      </ul>
