        affirmation that the likelihood of a disaster affecting us as individuals is low.
        It is important to remember that disasters have occurred in our region that would
        have a tremendous impact on our lives if they were to happen today. For example,
        it is not a matter of if we will experience a major earthquake it is a matter of
        when. </p>
      <p> Here are some facts about recent events in our Region: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 1946 - A magnitude 7.3 earthquake occurred near Courtenay. Structures were damaged as far away as North Vancouver.</li>
        <li> 1949 - A magnitude 8.1 earthquake occurred off the north coast of B.C. It was felt as far away as Jasper Alberta.</li>
        <li> 1962 - Hurricane Freda struck the coast of British Columbia. In Victoria, the winds reached 145 km/h: seven deaths were attributed to the storm.</li>
        <li> 1964 - One of the world&rsquo;s largest measured earthquakes occurred in Alaska. Within four hours a 7-metre (22 foot) tsunami hit Port Alberni.</li>
        <li> 1996 - A heavy snowfall paralyzed the Capital Region for seven days. Structures collapsed and many people with medical needs were unable to get help.</li>
        <li> 2003 - A Provincial State of Emergency was declared when 2518 forest fires broke out across B.C.      </li>
