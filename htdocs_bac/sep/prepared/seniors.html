      <ul>
        <li> Plan for family, friends, and neighbours to check on each other after an
          emergency, (telephones may not be working, so this should be arranged
          between people who live near one another).</li>
        <li> Keep a list of your medicines, allergies, and your special equipment.
          Include the name, address, and telephone number of your doctor, pharmacist,
          family members, clergy, or special friends. Take this list with you if you
          must leave home after an emergency.</li>
        <li> Falling objects pose one of the greatest hazards in an earthquake. Seniors
          may not be able to quickly get under a table or desk for protection. Get rid
          of hazards in the home that could fall and cause injury. If you cannot do
          these things yourself, ask a friend or family member for help.</li>
        <li> Keep a 72-hour supply of emergency food and water. Have a well-stocked first-aid
          kit, an extra pair of glasses, flashlight and batteries, portable radio, and
          essential medicine.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Special Needs</h2>
      <p> Many seniors have special needs. Taking the following actions can increase your
        chances of safely riding out an earthquake. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> If your life support equipment requires electricity, buy an emergency
          generator. It is important to know how to properly operate and fuel your
          equipment.</li>
        <li> If you use oxygen, have someone secure the tank to prevent it from tipping.
          If you use a wheelchair or walking aids, keep them near you at all times.
          If possible, have extra walking aids in different places in your home. </li>
        <li> Place a battery-operated night light in each room. In a power outage,
          they will stay on four to six hours.</li>
        <li>Have a whistle or horn to signal for help.</li>
        <li> If you use battery-operated equipment, store extra batteries and replace
          them when the shelf life is reached.</li>
      </ul>
