      <p><span class="align-centre"><a href="pdf/shelbourne_map.pdf"><img src="../../images/business/shelbourne_map.jpg" class="float-left" alt=""></a></span>On August 10, 2009, Saanich Council approved the <a
					    	href="pdf/saanich_terms_of_ref.pdf">Terms of Reference</a> for the Saanich Planning Dept. to undertake the Shelbourne Valley Action Plan. </p>
      <p> The intent of the Plan is to develop, in consultation with the community and other stakeholders, a comprehensive, long range (20 to 30 year) vision for an area 500 m on either side of Shelbourne St. from North Dairy Road in the south to Feltham Road in the north.</p>
      <h2>Plan Objectives</h2>
      <p> The Action Plan objectives will be guided by policies and principles contained in the Sustainable Saanich Official Community Plan (July, 2008). These include focusing multi family residential, commercial, institutional and civic development in existing Major and Neighbourhood Centres in a way that complements existing development. </p>
      <p> The creation of a balanced transportation corridor that accommodates walking, bicycling, transit and private motor vehicle use is a major objective. This complies with OCP policies to integrate alternatives to the private motor vehicle into the transportation system. Reducing the community's dependence on the private motor vehicle will contribute towards a reduction of Greenhouse Gas emissions and help mitigate Climate Change. Creating a balanced transportation corridor and encouraging more mixed use development will also result in more sustainable, walkable, neighbourhoods in which residents will be less dependent on private vehicle use to access employment and services. </p>
      <p> Other Plan objectives include enhancing existing neighbourhood attributes, developing an age friendly environment for the Valley's seniors, and protecting and enhancing the Valley's natural environment, including Bowker Creek.      </p>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p> The process for developing the Plan will involve public consultation. A Stakeholders Committee made up of stakeholders who live, work, or have a special interest in the Valley, will guide the public consultation process and assist in issue identification. Open Houses, surveys, and Community Mapping, are some of the tools that will be used to garner public input.</p>

      <h2>January 2010 Virtual Open House</h2>
      <p> Review the <a href="../../living/community/action/sc_virtual_open_house.pdf">January 2010 On-Line Open House</a>  and its collection of displays and maps on the Corridor.</p>
      <h2>2010 Survey and Community Mapping Results</h2>
      <p>From January to May 2010 the Shelbourne Valley Action Plan Vision Survey was distributed throughout the Shelbourne Corridor study area as well as on-line.&nbsp; The response was terrific with 593 paper copies and 204 on line surveys completed for a total of 797 returned surveys.</p>
      <p>The Vision Survey results from are shown in the <a href="../../living/community/action/RespondentsViews.pdf"><strong>Vision Survey Results Summary</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/living/community/action/Respondents.pdf"><strong>Vision S</strong></a><a href="http://www.saanich.ca/living/community/action/Respondents.pdf"><strong>urvey Respondents Profile</strong></a><em>.&nbsp;</em> The Vision Survey allowed respondents to identify issues, suggest solutions and voice their opinion on what the Valley should look like 30 years from now.&nbsp; The Respondents Profile includes information regarding the age, gender, residency etc. of the respondents.&nbsp; This gives us an understanding of who the respondents are, their relationship to the Valley, and whether the respondents represent a good cross section of the public that lives, works or commutes through the Valley (note that all respondents are anonymous).</p>
      <p>A community mapping exercise was done at the same time as the Vision Survey.&nbsp; The exercise involved putting information on a map, included in the paper copy of the survey, about where respondents live, work, shop etc. in the Valley as well as the routes they use to walk, bus, cycle and drive through the Valley.&nbsp; A table size map of the Valley was used at events and presentations (an estimated 1,300 people were exposed to the exercise) to gather similar information which was then compiled, along with survey information, into the community maps.&nbsp; Refer to the <strong><a href="../../living/community/action/CommunityMaps.pdf">Community Mapping Results</a></strong>.</p>
      <p>The surveys and the community mapping exercise, while not statistically valid, provide us with a good indication of how people feel about the Valley, their connection to it and their vision for it. The information will be used to help guide the development of Shelbourne Valley Action Plan Policies.</p>

      <p>The Shelbourne Valley Walkability Group was formed in September 2010. We are citizen volunteers associated with the SCAP Stakeholders Committee of the District of Saanich.</p>
      <p>        This report is the result of community educational outreach, on-the-ground research, and consultation over a period of six months to community associations, schools, University of Victoria, Camosun College, seniors residences, at the January 27, 2011 SCAP Open House, and from eye-witness accounts and photos from walking assessments in the Shelbourne Valley neighbourhoods.</p>
      <h2>Urban Land Use and Urban Design </h2>
      <p>On July 20, 2011, 23 members of the Shelbourne Valley Stakeholders Committee met with the urban design consultant team of D'Ambrosio Architecture + Urbanism and Landeca Services Inc. who had been hired to develop design guidelines for the Shelbourne Valley.&nbsp; The attached notes represent a summary of what was said at the meeting particularly with regard to existing and desired Land Use, Movement, and Form and Character in the Valley.&nbsp; Please review these notes and if you have any comments or additional suggestions feel free to contact the Project Planner, <a href="mailto:harold.stanley@saanich.ca">Harold Stanley</a>.</p>
      <p> Please <a href="../../living/community/action/notesfromjuly20mtgwstakeholders.pdf">view the notes</a> from the July 20th, 2011 meeting. </p>
      <p>As well as soliciting responses from Committee members regarding their vision of the Valley the urban design consulting team provided a <a href="../../living/community/action/1120SlidePres.pdf">power point presentation</a> on the value of good urban design, the elements of urban design, and an overview of the design objectives in the Shelbourne Valley.</p>

      <h2><a name="survey"></a>2012 Virtual Open House and Survey </h2>
      <p>A series of Open Houses were held in November 2012 to gather feedback from the public on the concepts and ideas from the Shelbourne Valley Action Plan Transportation Study and the Shelbourne Valley Land Use Urban Design Study. The concepts and ideas, and the feedback received on them from the open house survey, will be used to prepare the first draft of the Shelbourne Valley Action Plan. </p>
