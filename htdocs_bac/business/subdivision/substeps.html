        financial commitments or submitting a formal application. </p>

      <p> <img src="/images/business/woman_plans.jpg" class="float-left" alt="" />The <a
                     	href="../apps/pdf/appl4_sub.pdf">Subdivision Application Form</a> <img src="/images/logos/pdf.gif" alt="PDF document"> contains a checklist outlining all of the

      <h2>3.&nbsp; Application Circulation and Review</h2>
      <p> <img src="/images/business/survey_box.jpg" class="float-right" alt="Survey" />Applications will be
        circulated for review and comment to internal departments and external agencies where appropriate.
        Depending on the complexity of a proposal, applicants may be asked to provide additional
        information if required by the Approving Officer. </p>
      <p> The Approving Officer has a statutory responsibly to determine if the deposit of a proposed
        subdivision plan is against the public interest and, in this regard, may hear from all persons who
        may be affected by the subdivision. Applicants will be required to erect a notification sign on
        the subject property, a referral will be sent to the local community association and proposed
        development details will be posted on the Saanich website. </p>
      <h2>4.&nbsp; Conditional Subdivision Approval</h2>
      <p> Conditional Subdivision Approval is granted in the form of a letter outlining a comprehensive
        statement of conditions precedent to final approval of the subdivision. Conditional Approval is
        valid for one year and may include requirements such as: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Subdivision layout, road alignments and lot dimensions;</li>
        <li>Dedication of parkland or cash-in-lieu;</li>
        <li>Protection of the natural environment;</li>
        <li>Covenants, easements and statutory rights-of-way;</li>
        <li>Engineering servicing requirements;</li>
        <li>External agency requirements;</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>5.&nbsp; Completion or Bonding of Subdivision Works and Services</h2>
      <p> <img src="/images/business/diamond_sign.jpg" class="float-left" alt="men working sign" />Applicants must retain the services of a professional engineer who will design the works and
        services required in accordance with the Subdivision Bylaw. All services are required to be
        installed at the owner&rsquo;s expense prior to final subdivision approval, unless the owner
        provides bonding and enters into a subdivision servicing agreement with the Municipality to
        complete the required works by a specified date.</p>
      <h2>6.&nbsp; Submission for Final Subdivision Approval</h2>
      <p> <img src="/images/business/counter.jpg" class="float-right" alt="Counter" />Once all the requirements outlined in the Conditional Approval letter have been addressed,
        applicants may submit an application for final subdivision approval to the Approving Officer. The
        application would typically include: Final survey plans prepared by a British Columbia Land
        Surveyor, approval fees and documentation satisfying all requirements outlined in the Conditional
        Approval. If appropriate, the Approving Officer will approve the subdivision by signing the
        Subdivision Plan.</p>
      <h2>7.&nbsp; Plan Registration</h2>
      <p> <img src="/images/business/check_mark.jpg" class="float-left" alt="Check!" />Once the subdivision plans and documents are signed by the Approving Officer, they are returned to
        the applicant for registration at the Victoria Land Title Office. This is the process that creates
        legal title for each new parcel defined on the subdivision plan.</p>
