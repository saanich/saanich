      <h2>What is a park natural area?</h2>
      <p><img src="/images/parksrec/parks/natural_areas003.JPG" class="float-right" alt="">Saanich park natural areas are defined as spaces that are relatively undisturbed and contain a high percentage of native species, providing habitats for a diversity of native wildlife. They are natural or near natural in character, or are in the process of recovery from human disturbance. These areas may represent or contain fragments of regionally typical ecosystems; they may contain habitat for endangered plant and animal species. They help maintain a diversity of living organisms through the conservation of wild genetic resources (after Dunster &amp; Dunster 1996). </p>
<p>Compared with cultured or manicured areas, park natural areas generally require less routine and intensive management to ensure their sustainability; however, because they are situated within urban areas and are usually degraded, they require active management. </p>
      <p>Zoning alone does not necessarily identify park natural areas. Often, they occur in parks zoned other than P4N, such as in Glasgow, Playfair or Beckwith parks. Sometimes they are smaller elements within a P4N park that contains many recreational amenities, such as Layritz Park or Cedar Hill Park. </p>
      <p>Many small land parcels have been zoned P4N to satisfy development permit requirements. Too often these are infested with invasive plants and are too small or isolated to warrant restoration. Although these spaces can offer some wildlife values and may contain some native plants, they are not considered park natural areas. </p>
      <p>Similarly, although spaces such as rain gardens, oldfields, seasonally flooded lowlands, and un-mowed road rights-of-way offer ecological value, they are not considered park natural areas. &nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Managing our park natural areas</h2>
      <p>In the past, Saanich managed park natural areas through a hands-off approach, following the common thinking of the day that it&rsquo;s best to let nature to take care of itself. In more recent years we realized that human-caused disturbance and the spread of alien invasive species have disrupted natural ecological processes and that natural areas cannot maintain themselves in a healthy ecological state; active management is needed.</p>
      <p>In 2003, a strategy for invasive species was collaboratively developed between Environmental Services and Parks. In 2005 the Parks Department began to shift toward active management of park natural areas. One result was a departmental restructuring in 2005 and the staffing of a new position of Manager of Urban Forestry, Horticulture, and Natural Areas (UFHNA). </p>
      <p>A 2006 survey of Saanich citizens clearly demonstrated that the public supports recreational opportunities, parks and trails, and protecting the natural environment. This was echoed through rising community interest in volunteer stewardship, and expectations for more ecosystem-based decision making in park operations. To meet the growing demands of community-based stewardship, in 2006 Parks secured a part-time Environmental Education Officer. </p>
      <p>In 2008 a workshop and survey was held for volunteers with a goal of building capacity and public engagement in park natural areas stewardship. The survey results were the basis of the &ldquo;Searle Report&rdquo; (EKOS Communications 2008) which contained a number of recommendations that have been incorporated into this Action Plan.      </p>
      <p><img src="../../../images/parksrec/parks/natural_areas001.JPG" class="float-right" alt="">Throughout this period, in addition to supporting volunteer activities, Saanich staff have undertaken a number of restoration initiatives, such as various native plantings in Mount Douglas, Camas, Bow, and Cedar Hill parks; and education initiatives such as new web pages, brochures, invasive species information sheets, and rapid response to new invasive species that threaten park natural areas&mdash;garlic mustard in particular.</p>
      <p>In 2009, the Natural Areas Working Group (NAWG) was established to forge collaboration between Environmental Services and Parks particularly on invasive species management. In mid-2009, a funding reallocation allowed staffing of a full-time Natural Areas Technician as a technical resource to the parks division. </p>
      <p>In 2011 Saanich Parks developed the Saanich <a href="../info/pdf/MicrosoftWord-NaturalAreasGuidelinesCoryFinalVersionJune2011.pdf">Park Natural Areas Management Guidelines</a> document that defines the framework within which park natural areas are managed to provide the best possible benefit to residents living within Saanich and the Capital Regional District. These guidelines have been developed to help us make appropriate decisions as we undertake new development in park natural areas or to guide the Parks Divisions operations, and maintenance activities within park natural areas. Active management is needed to protect and enhance our park natural areas and the benefits and services they provide. </p>
      <p>In 2011 Saanich Parks also drafted a <a href="../info/pdf/MicrosoftWord-NaturalAreasActionPlanCoryJune2011.pdf">Park Natural Area Action Plan 2012 -2017</a>. This Action Plan describes the major management initiatives to be undertaken in our park natural areas over the next five years. The initiatives are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Invasive Species Management Strategy (Started in May 2011 to be completed in November 2011)</li>
        <li>Mapping, inventory &amp; monitoring</li>
        <li>Community collaboration &amp; outreach</li>
        <li>Park Management Plans</li>
        <li>Best Management Practices</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Urban Forest Strategy (UFS), adopted by Council in 2010, provides a long-term plan for achieving a sustainable urban forest, much of which occurs in park natural areas. Implementing the UFS has synergy with the Park Natural Areas Action Plan.</p>
      <h2>Species and ecosystems at risk</h2>
      <p><img src="../../../images/clip_image002_005.jpg" class="float-right" alt="">Our park natural areas represent several ecosystems, including wetland, riparian, coastal bluff, Coastal Douglas-fir, and Garry Oak ecosystems. Each of these has unique features and challenges, and many contain rare and at-risk ecological communities. Nineteen federally listed species-at-risk (SAR) are known to occur in Saanich park natural areas, which contain 31 occurrences of these species (i.e., some SAR occur in more than one park natural area). Rare species surveys have been done in some but not all park natural areas. Nonetheless, we take several progressive steps to protect our SAR by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>working with federal Recovery Strategy team representatives to inventory selected SAR populations</li>
        <li>undertaking protection and restoration for four SAR species at five locations</li>
        <li>implementing habitat conservation and supporting population enhancement if called for through a federal Recovery Strategy </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, Saanich supports or undertakes many restoration-focused projects aimed at habitat enhancement and protection. For example, more than 1000 native trees and shrubs were planted in park natural areas in 2009 and over 3000 in 2010.</p>
