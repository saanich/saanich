          <p>The District of Saanich Park Natural Areas Management Guidelines document defines the framework within which park natural areas are managed to provide the best possible benefit to residents living within Saanich and the Capital Regional District. They have been developed to help us make appropriate decisions as we undertake new development in park natural areas or to guide the Parks Divisions operations, and maintenance activities within park natural areas. Urbanization, recreational use and development expose park natural areas to activities that can degrade their quality and integrity. Managing park natural areas and urban development means finding a balance between ecology and human activity. This brings challenges as we steer our way through often conflicting needs and demands.</p></td>

          <p>A significant portion of Saanich&rsquo;s park lands contain natural areas. These vary in ecological integrity: some contain intact rare ecosystems while others are dominated by invasive plants. In all cases, our park natural areas contribute to the environmental, social and economic well-being of the community. Active management is needed to protect, enhance and restore our park natural areas and the benefits and services they provide.&nbsp;</p></td>

            <p>Residents in the District of Saanich have always placed a high value on parks, trails, and open spaces. The municipal parks system includes over 160 parks, an extensive trail network and many environments that are unique in the province. </p>
            <p> The Saanich Park Property Inventory is meant to be used as a tool to provide background information during the Parks and Recreation Masterplan process scheduled to begin soon.
              One objective of the Parks and Recreation Masterplan will be to create a Parks Priority Guide for the acquisition of new parkland in our community.</p></td>

            <p>The District of Saanich (Saanich) has more than 85 km of trails. The trail system will continue to grow and change over the next 15&ndash;20 years. There will also be upgrades to existing trails as budgets will allow. New demands will be made on the trail system to reflect the changing needs, technology, and preferences of the population. Changes such as the use of different types of bicycles and the increasing use of trails for commuter cycling will have an effect.</p>
            <p>              To guide future trail planning, design and development, Saanich Parks and Recreation has prepared these Trail Guidelines.</p></td>

            <p>The Urban Forest is a vital component of our community. They occur as street trees, park trees, private trees and in natural areas or remnant forest stands. Our goal, as described in the Urban Forestry Strategy, is to protect and enhance the urban forest, however, our obligation is to also provide a safe setting for staff and the public. </p>
            <p>Saanich Urban Forestry staff utilize our Tree Risk Assessment and Abatement Procedures (2011) when assessing trees on boulevards and within our parks. These procedures clearly lay out the rational used for visually and detailed risk assessment. We use this procedure when reviewing consulting arborist reports related to development as well as for service requests from the public. </p></td>

            <p>On November 1, 2010, Council adopted the Urban Forest Strategy for Saanich</p>
            <p>The Urban Forest Strategy provides a long&ndash;term plan for achieving a sustainable urban forest in Saanich. It is one of the tools that Council, staff and the community will be able to use in conjunction with the Sustainable Saanich Official Community Plan 2008 (OCP), Saanich Strategic Plan 2010 and other municipal bylaws, plans, policies and/or initiatives. </p>
