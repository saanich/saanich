    <h2>What is the Centennial Trails project?</h2>
    <p> The trails and walkways in Saanich are diverse and provide opportunities for recreation,
      transportation, exploration, and connection of the rural and cultural richness of our
      community. </p>
    <h3>Trail Pages </h3>

    <p> The principle of preserving trail connections and creating new ones is embodied in the
      District of Saanich's Official Community Plan - a guiding document for future land use and
      development. Over the years, trails have been established throughout the community for the use
      and enjoyment of residents and visitors alike. Some of these trails include: Colquitz River
      Trail, Galloping Goose Regional Trail, Lochside Regional Trail and Blenkinsop Lake 
      Crossing, Glendale Trail, Interurban Rail Trail and Blenkinsop Greenway </p>
    <p> As part of the celebration of 100 years of municipal incorporation in 2006, the District of
      Saanich embarked on the Centennial Trails project. Approved by Council in December, 2003, this
      project intended to build upon existing trails and make multi-use trail connections east/west
      and north/south to all geographic areas of the municipality. The east/west trail connections
      will eventually link Francis King Regional Park to Mt. Douglas Park. </p>
    <p> The project will be undertaken in two phases.&nbsp; Both phases of the project,
      Phase 1 (2004 to 2006) and Phase 2 (2006 and beyond) include trail improvements and construction
      of new trails. All of the trail segments will be tied together with distinctive and cohesive
      wayfinding and information signs. </p>
    <p> Funding for the $3.99 million Phase 1 of the project is in part provided by the Canada-British
      Columbia Infrastructure Program ($1.468 million), with the remainder from the District
      (approximately $2.522 million). The estimated cost for Phase 2 is $3.30 million. </p>
