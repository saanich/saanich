      <p>The District of Saanich has made strategic commitments to Balanced Transportation, Healthy Communities and Sustainable Environments. One way to achieve the goals set out in that plan was to develop significant trails and greenways throughout the municipality. The &ldquo;Centennial Trails 2006 and Beyond&rdquo; is a plan to develop nearly 45 km of trails making connections north-south and east-west to all geographic areas of the community. </p>
      <p>Saanich has always had a long standing belief in the value of trails and greenways for the community. </p>
      <p>Centennial Trails Phase 1 was successful in creating and improving the San Juan Greenway, Blenkinsop Greenway, Royal Oak Trail, Glendale Trail, Interurban Rail Trail and the Colquitz River Trail.</p>
      <p>Building on this success is an ambitious plan to further these major trail routes in Saanich. Trails being considered for improvements are the Bowker Creek Greenway, Saanich Commonwealth Place to Beaver Lake Park Connector, Calvert Trail, and further improvements to the popular Colquitz River Trail.</p>
      <p>In 2008, Saanich was successful in securing $235,000 from the Provincial LocalMotion program for the Bowker Creek Greenway Phase 1 project in Browning Park. The District of Saanich plans on continuing to seek funding opportunities for future trails in our community.</p>
      <h2>Bowker Creek Greenway</h2>
      <p>The vision for the Bowker Creek Greenway will see it extend from Oak Bay, through Victoria and Saanich to the University of Victoria connecting parks, commercial centres and schools along the entire 6.5km route. </p>
      <p>The first phase of this project will include improvements and additions to the multi-use trail network along the Greenway in Browning Park and connections to the park. </p>
      <p>The new trail and improvements to existing narrow sections of the trail, completed in 2011, will create both pedestrian and cycling infrastructure that provides an alternative to Shelbourne Street &nbsp;along with environmental rehabilitation of the creek. The project included: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>360m of new and improved trail (3.0m width)</li>
        <li>1 new crosswalk</li>
        <li>2 new bridges (replacement of existing old narrow bridges in poor condition)</li>
        <li>Directional Route Marking Signs</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Bowker Creek Initiative</h2>
      <p>The Bowker Creek Initiative is a collaboration between local governments, community groups, post-secondary institutions and private citizens, to improve the health of Bowker Creek and its watershed. </p>
      <p>The Bowker Creek Watershed Management Plan includes an objective to create a multi-use greenway corridor from the headwaters (University of Victoria) to the ocean, in accordance with a regional greenway system. </p>
      <p>A greenway that follows Bowker Creek could provide riparian and aquatic habitat as well as providing an alternative transportation route that links parks, neighbourhoods, commercial centres and public facilities. &nbsp;Visit <a href="http://www.bowkercreekinitiative.ca/">www.bowkercreekinitiative.ca</a> for more information about the Bowker Creek Initiative.</p>
      <h2>Saanich Commonwealth Place to Beaver Lake Park Trail</h2>
      <p>Planning and design for this section of trail continues in partnership with CRD Parks , the Royal Oak Golf Course and the community to make this important trail connection.&nbsp; Saanich Parks continually seeks funding opportunities for this trail project. </p>
      <h2>Future Trail Development</h2>
      <p>Trail development continues to be a priority for Saanich Parks. Over the next several years through the Park&rsquo;s Capital Budget and/or grants the plan is to achieve the balance of the Centennial Trails vision.</p>
