      <img src="/images/parksrec/parks/trails_biking.jpg" class="float-right" alt="">
      <p> The Blenkinsop Greenway links the Gordon Head area and the University of Victoria to the
        Lochside Regional Trail. It is anticipated that weekday commuters will make an east/west
        connection to the Lochside Regional Trail and on to downtown, avoiding busy roads, families
        will enjoy the connection to the regional trails, and students attending Reynolds Secondary
      School will walk/cycle to school using this alternative route. </p>
      <p><a href="pdf/interurban_rail_trail.pdf">Interurban Rail Trail</a> <img src="/images/logos/pdf.gif" alt=""></p>
      <p> The Interurban Rail Trail parallels West Saanich Road, extending north to Wallace Drive. This
        trail provides a new major link in the north part of Saanich, following the historic BC
        Electric Railway route for most of its 4.5 km length. </p>

      <p> New sidewalks, improved bike facilities and the installation of signs along San Juan Avenue
        will acknowledge its designation in the "Gordon Head Action Plan: Greenways, Bikeways and
        Pedestrian Mobility". This route  connects local residents to parks, Gordon Head Recreation
      Centre, local schools, and the Regional and east/west trail systems. </p>
      <p><a href="pdf/glendale_trail.pdf">Glendale Trail</a> <img src="/images/logos/pdf.gif" alt=""></p>
      <p> The Glendale Trail takes you through the Vancouver Island Technology Park, Horticulture Centre of the Pacific and Layritz Park. These multi-use trails have been widened and had improvements
        to their surface. The trail connects the Interurban Rail Trail. </p>
      <p><a href="pdf/colquitz_river_trail.pdf">Colquitz River Trail</a> <img src="/images/logos/pdf.gif" alt=""></p>
      <p> The Colquitz River Trail links north/south through the Gorge, Carey and Royal Oak local areas.
        It is a popular multi-use trail for pedestrians and cyclists. The long term vision of Colquitz
        River Trail is to follow the river to Beaver Lake. Work in Phase 1 included a number of
        improved road crossings along the existing route. Future phases will include new trails and upgrades
        to existing sections. </p>

      <img src="/images/parksrec/parks/trails_mann.jpg" class="float-right" alt="">
      <p> The Royal Oak Underpass at the Pat Bay Highway provides a key east/west connection. West of the highway, the trail parallels West
        Saanich Road, travels west past Brydon Park, and on to Lindsay Street where it turns south and
        becomes the Colquitz River Trail.
      East	of	the	underpass the trail follows local streets, branching to provide two options for connecting with the Lochside Regional Trail. </p>
