      <p>A public open house was held on June 18, 2013 at Cedar Hill Golf Course where information was presented on the proposed changes to the bylaw. An online feedback survey was also available from June 18th to July 31st. The survey is now closed. Please send any comments or concerns to <a href="mailto:parks@saanich.ca">parks@saanich.ca</a>. </p>
      <p>Over the next month we will review the comments and results and prepare recommendations to reivew with the public and stakeholders. </p>
      <p><strong>What is the urban forest and why is it important?</strong></p>
      <p>Saanich&rsquo;s urban forest is the sum total of all trees and their associated ecosystems within the municipality.&nbsp; Urban forests play an important role in contributing to Saanich&rsquo;s environmental integrity and climate change resiliency. They filter air and water, create shade, provide habitat, and slow wind and storm water.</p>
      <p>A recent study has shown that Urban Forest Canopy cover was reduced by about 2.5 % between 2005 and 2009.&nbsp; These downward trends require a plan to ensure that future residents of Saanich enjoy the same benefits of an Urban Forest as we do today.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><strong>How will amending the Tree Preservation Bylaw protect and enhance the urban forest?</strong></p>
      <p>Two important measures we can take to help meet the Urban Forest Strategy goal to &ldquo;Protect and Enhance the Urban Forest&rdquo; are retaining more trees and planting replacement trees after trees are removed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By amending the Tree Preservation Bylaw to protect trees and require planting replacement trees, we can ensure the long term sustainability of the Urban Forest canopy.</p>
      <p><strong>What information has been considered in the preparation of the proposed amendments?</strong></p>
      <p>The Sustainable Saanich Official Community Plan 2008 and Saanich Urban Forest Strategy provide the policy direction to amend the Tree Preservation Bylaw. We have also reviewed many other policy or regulatory documents along with Tree Preservation Bylaws from other jurisdictions that inform our recommendations.</p>
      <p>This current consultation builds on past efforts held with the public and stakeholders for the Urban Forest Strategy and comments received during the past process have been considered in developing the proposed amendments.</p>
      <p><strong>What are the proposed amendments to the Tree Preservation Bylaw?</strong></p>
      <p>The proposed amendments to the Tree Preservation Bylaw will protect more trees and require replacement of any tree approved for removal. These amendments are summarized below:&nbsp; </p>
      <p><em><strong>Protected Trees:</strong></em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Protect seedlings of Arbutus, Garry Oak, Pacific Yew and Pacific Dogwood.</li>
        <li>Protect Douglas fir, Western Red Cedar, Big Leaf Maple and Grand fir trees at 30 cm diameter at breast height (DBH). </li>
        <li>Protect all other trees at 60 cm DBH (Maples, Oaks, Elms, Planes and Cypress).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em><strong>Building Envelopes and Development:</strong></em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Require one replacement tree for each protected tree approved for removal within a building envelope (1:1).</li>
        <li>Require two replacement trees for each protected tree approved for removal outside the building envelope for site servicing, access or driveway construction (2:1). </li>
      </ul>
      <p><em><strong>Rural Zoned Lands/ ALR:</strong></em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allow the removal of one protected tree per acre per calendar year (a replacement tree will not be mandated). Any protected tree approved for removal, above and beyond the criteria above, will require a replacement tree.</li>
        <li>Require two replacement trees for each protected tree approved for removal for site servicing or driveway construction (2:1). </li>
      </ul>
      <p><em><strong>Replacement Trees:</strong></em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Replacement trees will be required for the removal of any protected tree.</li>
        <li>Support for replacement tree planting will be provided for protected trees that are dead, dying, diseased, hazardous or impacting infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Replacement trees sureties may be transferred to Saanich and used to plant replacement trees on other private or public lands.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em><strong>Administration:</strong></em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A tree permit application fee of $75.00 along with a per tree fee of $25 will be levied for any protected tree approved for pruning or removal as a result of an approved development.</li>
        <li>Tree Pruning Permits will be available online through ISA Certified Arborists.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>How is the community being consulted on these proposed amendments?</strong></p>
      <p>Community and stakeholder input is an important part of the process to amend the Tree Preservation Bylaw.&nbsp; Community Stakeholder consultation will take place in May 2013 to discuss the impacts of the proposed changes and hear their concerns.&nbsp; Saanich will also hold a Public Open House on June 18, 2013 from 6 - 9 pm at the Cedar Golf Course Banquet Room. An online survey will be made available to ensure everyone has a chance to provide their ideas and concerns.</p>
      <p> We encourage your participation in these events.&nbsp; Please let us know how you feel about the recommended changes to the Tree Preservation Bylaw by joining in on the conversation.</p>
