      <h2>Tree Preservation Bylaw - Summary</h2>
      <p>The Saanich Vision reflects the community commitment to the urban forest by preserving and protecting our native and significant trees.&nbsp; These trees provide much of the beauty and heritage that we recognize as important in preserving our environment and quality of life.</p>
      <p>The purpose of the Tree Preservation Bylaw is to prevent the unnecessary removal and damage of protected trees on all lands within the Municipality.</p>
      <p>The information provided below is a condensed summary of the full Tree Preservation Bylaw.</p>
      <p>The Bylaw prohibits tree damaging activies such as topping or removal of any branch or trunk of a tree having a diameter of more than 10 centimetres (3.9 inches), cutting or damaging the roots, depositing harmful substances, blasting or fill inside the protected root zone of a tree.</p>
      <p><strong>The Bylaw also prohibits the removal of:</strong></p>

        <li><strong><u>and Any Other Tree over 80 centimetres (31.5 inches) in diameter</u></strong> including significant trees.</li>
      </ul></div>
      <p><strong><em>How to measure the diameter of a tree:</em></strong></p>
      <p>        The diameter of a tree is measured 1.4 metres (4.5 feet) above the ground. It can be determined by dividing the circumference by 3.142. Inquiries pertaining to Tree Preservation on private property, as well as requests work on public property, can be made to the Parks office at 250-475-5522. </p>
      <h2>Pre-Permit Criteria</h2>
      <p>Before you can receive a Permit as required by the Tree Preservation Bylaw No. 7632 you must meet minimum tree preservation criteria.</p>
      <p>THE PLAN AND INVENTORY All protected trees must be shown on a plan. The location of each tree must be accurately plotted showing the trunk diameter and Protected Root Zone (PRZ). An inventory list of the protected trees on the site is
        necessary to identify the trees covered by a permit. If there are more than four (4) trees present a separate sheet for the inventory should be provided. Inventories of four (4) trees or less may be listed on the plan. The inventory shall assign each protected tree a reference number that is to be shown on the plan and the inventory. The trunk diameter (accurate to 1 cm) and Protected Root Zone (PRZ) (accurate to .5 m) must also be shown.</p>
      <p>The diameter is determined by dividing trunk circumference at 1.4 m (4.5 feet) above the ground by 3.142. The PRZ is determined by multiplying the trunk diameter by 18. This calculates the radius of a circle around the trunk considered the tree&rsquo;s root area.</p>
      <h2>Protective Fencing</h2>
      <p>Sturdy reinforced snow or other substantial fencing must be placed around any protected tree on the development site. The fencing must be installed before your permit will be issued. The fencing must remain upright and intact as long as development occurs. The fencing shall be placed to the edge of the PRZ and staked to include the PRZ area inside the fenced area. If the protected root zone is inside the building envelope the fencing is to be installed along the building envelope line or the agreed upon construction zone line.</p>
      <h2>Storage of Materials on Site</h2>
      <p>All materials: Soil, fill, lumber, equipment, etc., that are to be stored on site must remain outside the PRZ and/or outside the protective fence area.</p>
      <h2>Site Servicing Locations</h2>
      <p>The in-ground site services must be located so as to minimize damage to protected trees. If no service access is possible without impacting protected trees then damage limiting techniques must be employed. In cases where removal if protected trees must occur to allow service installation, replacement trees may be required. A replacement tree bond is required to ensure tree planting will take place at a location on site with consultation with Parks Staff.</p>
      <h2>Blasting</h2>
      <p>Blasting causes more damage to trees than almost any other construction activity. An on site meeting with the blaster and owner/contractor must be arranged to appraise expected damage and discuss damage limiting techniques. This meeting must take place before a permit can be issued.</p>
      <h2>Arborists' Reports and Service</h2>
      <p>A report from a certified arborist will be necessary if you wish to remove a protected tree due to conditions that are not obvious on a visual inspection. This would include estimation of critical root loss and assessing soundness of trees with visible defects. A certified arborist's services will be required for tree pruning to clear for building envelope air space, utility line corridors and driveway access. Root pruning by a certified arborist prior to excavation will be required if a service trench or excavation is to be made in the protected root zone and conditions are determined unfavourable for preservation of the critical roots.</p>
      <h2>Offence &amp; Fines</h2>
      <p>Tree damaging activities as defined in Section 9(a) of the Tree Preservation Bylaw are ticketing offences and subject to no less than a $100.00 fine for each tree. More serious damages or the removal of protected trees bring penalties of no less than $500.00 per tree for the first offence and $1,000.00 per tree for each subsequent offence.</p>
