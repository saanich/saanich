      <p>Originally known as &quot;Hill of Cedars&quot;, the Mount Douglas forest was the source of the cedar pickets used 
  to construct Fort Victoria in 1843.</p>
      <p>Established in 1858 as a Government Reserve by Governor James Douglas, this park has always been a popular destination. A government official turned down a farm lease application of the reserve lands as he recognized it as &quot;a place of habitual resort&quot;. </p>
      <p>The construction of Churchill Road was the result of government work projects initiated in the Depression years. A tea house, washroom and &quot;crew huts&quot; were additional facilities present in the park. </p>
      <p>On September 30, 1889 the land was transferred to the City of Victoria and named Mount Douglas Park. The park was transferred to Saanich Parks in 1992, and the spirit and intent of the original Crown Grant of 1889 was expanded in the Mount Douglas Park Charter. The park has grown from 150 ha (350 ac) to 182 ha (450 ac) to ensure that the whole park will continue as a wilderness preserve.</p>

      <h2>Mount Douglas Park Charter</h2>
      <h1><img src="../images/HPIM2412_000.JPG" class="float-right" alt="mount douglas park charter" width="300" height="225"></h1>
      <p>The lands known as Mount Douglas Park are hereby reserved in perpetuity for the protection and preservation of the natural environment for the inspiration, use and enjoyment of the public.</p>
      <p>This land has been transferred by the Province of British Columbia to the Corporation of the District of Saanich on the condition that it be maintained and preserved as a public park.</p>
      <p>With is charter, the spirit and intent of the original crown grant of 1889 is maintained while its scope is expanded to include within Mount Douglas Park all adjacent municipal parklands, present and future, so the whole will continue as a wilderness preserve for generations to come. </p>
      <p>Proclaimed this 22nd day of November, 1992, by the Council of the Corporation of the District of Saanich on behalf of the citizens of Saanich.</p>
