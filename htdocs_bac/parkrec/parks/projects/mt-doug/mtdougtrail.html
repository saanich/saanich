      <p>April 2011</p>
<p> Trail wayfinding signs were installed along the Irvine Trail in Mount Douglas Park&nbsp;to test&nbsp;some new materials and trail marking signage. This type of&nbsp;trail marking has not been used before in Saanich. Developed in conjunction with the Friends of Mount Douglas, the goal of this project is to improve information for trail users and reduce damage from unauthorized trail use in the park.</p>
      <p> At trail junctions, plastic wood posts were installed. These posts look similar to the previously used wood posts, but require substantially less maintenance. Along steeper sections of the trail, and areas where the main trail needs to be identified, smaller metal cubes were installed closer to ground level.</p>
      <p> Both styles of wayfinding display a new system of trail difficulty rating. This rating system is based on the green circle - blue square - black diamond difficulty system many people are familiar with from ski resorts. In addition, a logo showing flat, rolling or steep terrain is included over the coloured symbol. The posts also offer an opportunity to communicate other messages such as "no bikes" if appropriate.</p>
      <p> The success of this trial has led to expanding this approach to other trails in Mount Douglas Park, and potentially to other park trails throughout Saanich.</p>
      <p> If you have any comments on this new approach to wayfinding, we would love to hear from you. Please contact us at (250) 475-5522 or email <a href="mailto:parks@saanich.ca">parks@saanich.ca</a>.      </p>
