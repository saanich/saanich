      <p>The Douglas Creek watershed is heavily urbanized. Most of the watershed is now served by storm drains and only the lower 800 metres of Douglas Creek within Mt. Douglas Park remains as an open channel.&nbsp; This has resulted in peak flows in the creek increasing over the years. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>The Creek has eroded into the clay substrate thus disconnecting the streambanks and the flood plains from the wetted channel. Douglas Creek can be thought of as three distinct sections. The lower section has been the focus of our in-stream restoration for the past fifteen years, approximately nine restoration sites where riffle or pool habitats have been augmented or established. </p>
      <p>This work has been spearheaded by the Friends of Mount Douglas Park Society in partnership with Saanich Parks, Pacific Salmon Foundation, Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Howard English Hatchery at Goldstream and the Pacific Forestry Center and includes the in-stream restoration as well as interpretive signage, public education events and awareness and riparian vegetation restoration. </p>
      <p>The urban watershed and weir form another section and control the water flowing into the creek. We currently have a separate engineering study initiated by the District of Saanich to address storm flows and pollution.</p>
      <p>Over the previous 15 years, work in Douglas Creek has engaged the public in salmon issues in British Columbia, the importance of spawning and rearing salmon in the urban environment, and specifically the return of salmon to Douglas Creek. Previous in-stream improvements in Douglas Creek have been followed up with riparian plantings engaging hundreds of volunteers and several community partners.</p>
      <p>In 2010 several planning and stakeholder sessions were held and the following information describes the vision, mission and goals moving forward. </p>
      <p><strong>Vision for Douglas Creek watershed </strong></p>
      <p>A healthy, properly functioning Douglas Creek watershed, suitable to sustain salmonid stocks and other wildlife, and stewarded for the long term by informed, educated and actively engaged citizens and local government.</p>
      <p><strong>Mission</strong><strong> Statement:</strong> </p>
      <p>To restore and maintain habitat, water quality and flow in the Douglas Creek watershed while educating the community about its values (within a sustainable manner).</p>
      <p><strong>Restoration Goals:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Continue to protect and restore habitats that support native species of plants and animals and also address threats to biodiversity such as invasive species. </li>
        <li>Retain and plant trees along boulevards and municipal properties, in parks and on private lands, to expand the urban forest and act as a mitigating measure with regard to storm water management. </li>
        <li>Support an integrated watershed planning approach for managing surface water, drainage, and ground water that promotes low impact development and healthy stream ecosystems. </li>
        <li>Work with senior levels of government and stakeholders to protect and enhance the marine, intertidal backshore, wetland and riparian habitats.</li>
        <li>Encourage the retention or planting of native vegetation in the riparian zone. </li>
        <li>Foster and support public awareness, engagement and participation in community environmental stewardship initiatives. </li>
        <li>To provide a healthy environment to restore and enhance increased and necessary populations of invertebrates, insects and other wildlife essential to the sustenance of salmonid stocks. </li>
        <li>Form a steering committee/advisory committee to direct operations in the Douglas Creek watershed. Membership should include DFO, Saanich, First Nations, Local Government and community stakeholders.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Douglas Creek Habitat Assessment Report and Instream Work 2012</h2>
      <p>In June 2012 the District of Saanich hired D.R. Clough Consulting to perform a habitat assessment on Douglas Creek.</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/DSCN1169_000.jpg" class="float-right" alt="creek work 5" width="250" height="188"></p>
      <p>The project objectives were to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conduct a habitat assessment of the entire day lighted channel of Douglas Creek;</li>
        <li>Identify best options/locations for an egg box;</li>
        <li>Assess the current condition of the in-stream enhancement work already completed in the lower watershed; and,</li>
        <li>Identify, prioritize and describe in-stream enhancement projects in the upper watershed, upstream of the Ash Road crossing. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>      The fish habitat assessment of Douglas Creek included activities that can improve water quality, through detention, reduction of sediment and erosion. We recommend that all water quality improvement activities be done first. Below is the suggested order of priority taken from the habitat items in this report. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conduct the priority maintenance areas in Reach 1;</li>
        <li>Repair the channels of Tributaries 1 and 2, to address sediment and riparian issues;</li>
        <li>Clean out all erosion sources in Reach 2&nbsp; such as the debris jams;</li>
        <li>Clean out the detention pond area and increase its size as large as possible;</li>
        <li>Protect exposed banks from further erosion at the LWD sites in Reach 2;</li>
        <li>Add spawning gravel and other fish habitat features in Reach 1 and 2;</li>
        <li>Conduct a riparian restoration plan for both Reach 1 and 2.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The work began in earnest on August 28, 2012 to repair the previous work completed in reach one below Ash Road. Dave Clough was on site for the next two weeks to provide valuable advice and oversee the work in the creek to repair weirs, place wood, repair banks and ensure that all Best Management Practices were followed. Georg Dischner &ndash; Friends of Mount Douglas Park Society Intern from Germany was also on site during the two week work period. Saanich staff assisted with all in stream works and Don Mann was contracted to provide the machinery. Over 30 tandem loads of large blast rock was placed in the creek to provide fish habitat, pool riffles, weirs and secure the slumping banks.</p>

      <p><img src="../../images/CreekWork_20120913_002.jpg" class="float-right" alt="creek work 4" width="250" height="188">The work was a success and special thanks to D.R Clough Consulting Ltd. (Dave Clough) George Dischner, Friends of Mount Douglas Park Society, Pacific Salmon Foundation, Goldstream Hatchery and Department of Fisheries and Oceans for their part in preparing the report and completing the first year recommendations. </p>
      <p>Saanich Staff and Georg Dischner also completed hazard tree removal and hand dug out the tributaries in the upper reach above Ash Road to ensure sediment deposits are reduced and water coming off Mount Douglas enters the creek through the channels versus flowing though the forested area.</p>
      <p>Habitat restoration will continue this fall as part of our restoration efforts in partnership with the community.</p>
      <p>Be sure to have a walk in the Park and check out the work that was completed in 2012.      </p>
