      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>Mount Douglas Park continues to be a popular destination park for the region and with the high number of park visitors an ongoing assessment of the health and management of the diverse habitats is required. </p>
      <p>An evaluation of the health of the trees in the parking lot area was completed and several trees were identified for removal due to their poor condition. In addition, the gate closure times were extended to 12 noon daily.</p>
      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <p>To provide a safe park experience, for both the parking lot and trail areas, and improve the condition of the parking area for ongoing maintenance and protecting the adjacent habitat. </p>
      <p>In response to community interest, Saanich Parks initiated the gate closure change, and also recognized the need to improve the condition of the existing parking area and provide addition stalls and other site amenities. </p>
      <h2>Public Process</h2>
      <p>Saanich Parks held the following community consultation process:</p>
      <p>Discussions with The Friends of Mount Douglas and the three Community Associations adjacent to the park; Cordova Bay Association, Gordon Head Residents' Association and Blenkinsop Valley Community Association. These meetings were held on site to review the concerns for the condition of the trees and the effects of the gate closure and a Concept Plan was developed to address the above objectives. Through this process, Parks determined the scope of the work to be accomplished for this project. </p>
      <h2>Project Scope      </h2>
      <p>Tree removals &amp; replanting: A number of trees needed to be removed and some were made into wildlife trees, many of these are dead or dying. This area of the park appears to be a disease centre which will require additional survey work and inspection over the course of the coming years. We will work on an overall replanting plan based on the root disease and agree that any removed or wildlife tree will be replaced with a native species tree on at a 2:1 ratio in the same area. </p>
      <p>The existing parking area was expanded to provide 10 additional stalls in the area where the tree removals were required. This has alleviated some of the congestion and destruction of the vegetation and ditch along the road edge. Concrete curbs will be installed to define the parking areas. </p>
      <p>Storm water management: We reviewed the storm water flow and the design for the new spaces allowed the storm water to continue to flow into the forest. The drainage course along the south edge of the roadway was considered as a bioswale with the properties of slowing the flows. There was gravel added into the existing swale, and logs placed to re-establish the road edge, as part of the work. </p>
      <p>Split rail fence: The &quot;Pathway Blend&quot; surface between the parking area and the split rail fence serves the purpose of providing an area for people to access their vehicles and also allows movement from the vehicles to the trails. This will assist with the restoration of the existing forest as it will direct traffic to the designated trails. &nbsp;The extension of this trail to connect to the new sidewalk from Shelbourne is projected for completion in fall 2010.</p>
      <p>Site amenities: A bike rack and trash can were provided in the new parking area. A Park Information Sign is also still in the works.</p>
      <h2>Funding</h2>
      <p> Saanich Parks received the Council approval for these parking lot improvements along with a
        budget of $50,000. These resources are generated from the funds received through the
        Telecommunication Facility at the summit of Mount Douglas Park. </p>
