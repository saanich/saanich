      Saanich Parks has numerous  facilities throughout our park system that meet the recreation/leisure needs within our 166 parks and over 750 Ha of parkland. However, much of the system is aging &amp; in need of refurbishment. The focus of the grant was on our Playgrounds (54), Sport Courts (19), Sports fields (62) &amp; Tennis Courts (35). Our staff conducted condition assessments in the spring of 2009 to identify the priorities for this $3M program.</p>
