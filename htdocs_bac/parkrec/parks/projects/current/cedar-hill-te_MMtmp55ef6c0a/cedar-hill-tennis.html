					    <p>Earlier this year the District of Saanich was contacted by a not for profit group called the Cedar Hill Clay Court Tennis Society to discuss the possibility of installing an outdoor clay court tennis facility.&nbsp; The proposed location is on the north side of the Cedar Hill Recreation Centre in Cedar Hill Park. The society has met with key community groups, attended local events and had ongoing discussions with Saanich Parks and Recreation staff to explain the proposal and to learn about key issues associated with the proposed facility. </p>
					    <p>The Society, which would fund the facility, has collected community feedback that has been incorporated into the planning and design of the facility. The Society is moving to the next step of community engagement. In response, Saanich Parks and Recreation held a public open house on October 2nd at Cedar Hill Recreation Centre to provide an opportunity for all members of the public to learn more about the project. Key members of the Society, as well as Saanich staff, were present to answer questions, provide information and hear feedback from the community. Surveys were also available  to fill out.</p>
					    <p><strong>Were You Unable to Attend the Open House</strong>? </p>
					    <p>If you were unable to attend this event you can still participate by viewing the display panels below and filling in the survey.&nbsp; </p>
					    <p><a href="unknown:">Online Survey </a></p>
					    <p>&nbsp;</p>
					    <p>The survey will be available online from Wednesday, October 3rd to Friday, October 19th. You can also view the panels and complete a survey questionnaire at the Cedar Hill Recreation Center.&nbsp; Community input will be summarized here after October 19th.</p>
