      <h2><a name="GorgeTillicumAllotmentGardens"></a>Proposed Gorge Tillicum Allotment Garden Site Facts </h2>
      <p>The District of Saanich recognizes the need for local food security and the development of community gardens. Both the Official Community Plan and the Strategic Plan 2013-2017 support agricultural initiatives within the municipality. The open field area in Gorge Park is the proposed location for a community allotment garden in the Tillicum Local Area. A local Gorge Park Community Garden Working Group, supported by the Gorge Tillicum Community Association and Gorge Tillicum Urban Farmers, has been established to collaborate with Saanich in the establishment of a community garden. </p>
      <h3>Overview <strong><img src="images/GorgeTillicumUpdatedMap.jpg" alt="Gorge Tillicum Community Garden Site" width="300" height="230" align="right"></strong>     <strong> </strong></h3>
      <p>Part of the open field located in Gorge Park has been proposed as the site for a potential community garden. Saanich will provide the land and the Gorge Tillicum Community Association will oversee operation and administration of the garden.</p>
      <h3>Fact Sheet</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Saanich supports community gardening and will provide the area shown on the map for a garden site.</li>
