        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Cadboro-Gyro Park is a unique Saanich asset and well loved by our community and the region but is in need of focused direction for future enhancements. </p>
        <p>Saanich Parks together with LADR Landscape Architects consulting team and the Cadboro Bay Residents Association have been working on revising the comprehensive masterplan for Cadboro-Gyro Park. </p>
        <p>The results of the open houses coupled with the ideas generated at the workshop revealed a few common themes and since then, a number of options for future improvements have been developed.</p>
        <h2>Cadboro Gyro Workshop </h2>
        <p>On Saturday, March 16th Saanich Parks hosted a facilitated workshop at the Cedar Hill Golf Clubhouse to engage community members. Key stakeholders from the earlier park planning process joineda fewmembers from the Cadboro Bay Residents Association,the association'spark sub-committee, Saanich Park Planners and consultants forthe all day session which was lead by an experienced facilitator. The intent was to revisit the current park concept plan to determine if there were ways to improve upon it and get the planning and design process moving forward.

        <p>As we want to recognize the park&rsquo;s unique character that is well loved by our community and the region, we want to make sure we have the desired outcome for future enhancements in the park.
