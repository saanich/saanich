      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>At the beginning of 2012 the District of Saanich was contacted by a non- profit group called the Cedar Hill Clay Court Tennis Society to discuss the possibility of installing an outdoor clay court tennis facility. The proposed location is on the north side of the Cedar Hill Recreation Centre in Cedar Hill Park. The Society has met with key community groups (e.g.: Quadra/Cedar Hill Community Association, Bowker Creek Initiative), attended local events and has had ongoing discussions with Saanich Parks and Recreation staff to explain the proposal and to learn about key issues associated with the proposed facility. </p>
      <p>The Society, which would fund the facility, has collected community feedback that has been incorporated into the planning and design of the facility. </p>
      <p>Saanich Parks and Recreation held a public open house on October 2nd at Cedar Hill Recreation Centre to provide an opportunity for all members of the public to learn more about the project. Key members of the Society, as well as Saanich staff, were present to answer questions, provide information and hear feedback from the community. Issues raised and still being explored include community access, change from &ldquo;open space&rdquo; to specific use, environmental considerations, etc. </p>

      <h2>Survey - October 2, 2012 Open House </h2>
      <p>A survey was first made available to the general public at the Open House on October 2, 2012. &nbsp;It and other background material was then available until October 26th online at the Saanich website or at the Cedar Hill Recreation Centre. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Several thousand individual comments were provided in response to the open ended survey questions. These are in the process of being reviewed, grouped into common themes and screened for personal content. An abbreviated summary of these comments will be provided at a later date.</p>
      <p>Over 900 surveys were received and the attached summary shows the results for the non-open ended survey questions.&nbsp; As the survey was a self-selected one and not a random sample, the results represent the opinion of those who chose to respond and should not be considered statistically accurate across the population.</p>

      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>Saanich staff are now reviewing and analyzing the information received from the survey, meetings with stakeholders, individual emails and letters, and community group feedback.&nbsp;Presentations to relevant Saanich Advisory Committees have taken place and should the Society continue with the proposal, presentation to Council's Committee of the Whole would potentially take place in the fall of 2013.</p>
