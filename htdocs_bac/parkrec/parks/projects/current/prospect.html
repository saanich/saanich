<h2>Help us Maintain the Health and Vitality of Prospect Lake</h2>
<p>Prospect Lake is an environmental and recreational treasure for those who call it home, and the larger Saanich community. It covers approximately 89 ha (220 acres), has an island and a series of natural bays. It has long been a popular fishing destination, and is stocked with about 1,000 &ndash; 5,000 Rainbow trout annually.</p>
<p>Prospect Lake has high nutrient levels periodically (especially phosphorus), which can cause algal blooms, heavy weed growth, lowered oxygen levels and reduced habitat capabilities. &nbsp;Roughly 1/3 of these nutrients come from watershed-streams, 1/3 from septic fields, and 1/3 from decomposing vegetation. </p>
<p>It has an average depth of 6m (20&rsquo;) which drops .5 - .8m (20-30&ldquo;) from May-October, and rises .6 - .9m (24-36&rdquo;) in the rainy season. Natural springs in the lake help ameliorate the dry season loss. Depth helps to lower temperature and inhibit algal blooms.</p>
<p>The quality of the lake&rsquo;s water depends of the health of its watershed, and all property owners within the watershed effect it. Common sources of excess phosphorus are septic fields, farm waste, fertilizer, and detergent. Residents can help to protect the lake by using phosphate-free soaps, and alternatives to fertilizers and pesticides. Proper installation and maintenance of septic systems is also important, and adding peat to garden beds, especially on the lake-side of septic fields, is recommended. To learn more about septic systems, or to find a qualified person to help you, refer to the CRD 'Septic Savvy' website.</p>
<p>Protecting and planting native trees and shrubs will also improve water quality and the area&rsquo;s ecological value. Removing invasive plants such as yellow-flag iris and golden willow assists native plants and animals to regain ground. Look into the&nbsp;'Saanich Pulling Together Program' to learn about volunteer invasive plant removal efforts around the lake.</p>
<h2>Prospect Lake Preservation Society</h2>
<p>Established in 2008, the PLPS has worked to improve the lake&rsquo;s biological health, reduce invasive species (bull frogs, golden willow, Eurasion Milfoil), promote safe lake recreation, improve community lake access, and improve communication within the community.</p>
<h2>Protect Sensitive Habitat</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Proceed slowly in shallow waters.</li>
  <li>Do not disturb wildlife.</li>
  <li>Avoid contact with submerged aquatic vegetation.</li>
  <li>Minimize your boat wake &ndash; it can lead to shore line erosion.</li>
  <li>Do not throw trash or cigarette butts overboard &ndash; plastic is deadly to fish and birds. Do not throw fish waste overboard.</li>
</ul>
