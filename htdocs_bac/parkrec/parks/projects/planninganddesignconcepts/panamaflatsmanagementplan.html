      <p>The announcement that the District of Saanich had acquired the property occurred in February, 2011. The acquisition was based on the desire to establish the site as public open space to provide flood plain management, optimize environmental values, create new park and trails and enhance food security. The sale and land transfer occurred in early December, 2011. The property consisting of 62.43 acres (25.26ha) was previously used for a variety of agricultural purposes for many decades. The Colquitz River, which is important fish habitat, runs along the western edge of the flats and has been dramatically altered by previous agricultural operations. When combined with adjacent parkland already owned by the District the total area of the site is approximately 163 acres (66.0ha). The zoning of existing parkland bordering the flats is P4 (Panama Hill) and P4N (natural park) in the park strip containing the Colquitz River.</p>

      <h3>Odour Problem </h3>
      <p>Upcoming work on Panama Flats is scheduled as the flats have not been actively farmed for several years and there has been a significant build up of vegetation and organic matter (eg. goose droppings) across the site. Saanich Parks will be undertaking measures to try and prevent a repeat of last winter's odour problem by reducing the build up of decaying organic matter which is suspected of causing the strong odour. The first step in the process involves letting the site dry out completely. With the recent hot, dry weather the site should be fully dry within a week or two. Beginning in mid to late August the existing vegetation that has overtaken the site will be mowed. Shortly afterwards the fields will be tilled to further breakdown the vegetation. It is anticipated these steps will cease or significantly reduce the odour problem.</p>

      <h3>Planning Process</h3>
      <p>Saanich Parks working with a multi-disciplinary team of consultants will be developing a management plan to guide the long range development and operation of the site. The management plan will establish;</p>

        <li>foundation principles, goals, objectives, exploration of options and analysis of &nbsp;consequences </li>
        <li>key outcomes including an achievable development concept and implementation strategy based on thorough community consultation</li>
        <li>a guide to future site use and operations </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some of the key site issues include;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Watershed, flood plain and storm water management</li>
        <li>Recent site alterations</li>
        <li>Environment - fisheries, waterfowl; rare plant and endangered bird species. </li>
