      <p>Saanich Parks continually works towards achieving the long range vision for the Colquitz River Trail. &nbsp; </p>
      <p> Much of the current&nbsp;Colquitz River Trail was constructed during the 1970's and early 1980's. To meet the needs of today's trail users and to address transportation alternatives, major improvements were identified during the Centennial Trails planning stage in 2003. Some of these improvements have been completed such as route marking signs, new crosswalks, a new concrete walkway to replace the old boardwalk and improvements to the connections to Tillicum Mall and Cuthbert Holmes Park. &nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>Several years ago, Saanich acquired the properties at 1105 Gerda Road, 4246 Grange Road and 1111 Loenholm Road and subsequently removed the houses and incorporated the land into the park system. </p>
      <p>Over the past few years, Saanich has been fortunate to receive Federal and Provincial funding for trail development in our community. Several of these projects are now complete and surplus funds remain. With most of this funding allocated to the development of new trails, Saanich Parks is proposing to use the remaining funds to complete a section of the Colquitz River Trail from Gerda to Loenholm to further the vision of the Colquitz River Trail. </p>
      <p>Following up on the&nbsp;public open house held on June 12, 2013, Saanich Parks will be undertaking construction of the new trail from Gerda to Loenholm in late August or early September. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Work in the park will include removing dead trees and some invasive vegetation, constructing the gravel trail and adding new trees. The presence of horsetail (an invasive plant which can damage pavement) along the trail route has lead to a decision to delay the installation of the asphalt surface. Instead, the trail will be constructed in gravel and monitored for horsetail over the next year or two to see how it affects the trail.</p>
