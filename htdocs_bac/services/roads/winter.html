      <h2>Saanich Snow and Ice Control </h2>
      <p>Modern cities are dependent on the free movement of fire trucks, police cars, ambulances, public transit vehicles, transport vehicles and private passenger vehicles.&nbsp; Unless the snow is removed promptly from pavements, large losses result from interrupted business activity and many workers are deprived of income if they cannot reach the place where they work.&nbsp; Urban drivers demand pavements that are clear of snow and ice, and they are willing to pay for this service.</p>
      <p>Saanich enjoys a mild and moist climate with winters that are not too cold and summers that are not too hot.&nbsp; Using data up to 1996, the lowest temperature is -15.6 C and the highest is 36.1 C.&nbsp; Average precipitation is 619mm at Gonzales and 858mm at the Victoria International Airport.&nbsp; The average snowfall is 49.9cm per year.&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Saanich Snow and Ice Response Plan      </h2>
      <h3>Streets</h3>
The major streets, transit routes, and collector streets that are designated as Snow Emergency
					    	Routes are treated and opened to traffic within twenty-four hours of a snowfall. We will
					    	endeavour to maintain a bare asphalt condition on such streets, provided there is no
					    	reduction in the level of service to our overall program. Major residential hills are also
					    	considered a high priority and every attempt is made to treat them within twenty-four hours of
					    	a snowfall. Minor collectors and residential streets are dealt with only after the top
					    	priority streets are taken care of, however, our objective is to have them treated and opened
					    	within seventy-two hours of a snowfall.
<h3>Bridges</h3>
Bridge decks are very susceptible to icing conditions and are given a high priority during
							heavy frost and black ice situations.
<h3>Lanes</h3>
Lanes are not cleared by the Municipality except in special circumstances when it is required
							for refuse collection or for an emergency.
<h3>Sidewalks</h3>
<p>Sidewalks are not cleared by the Municipality except on bridges, on pedestrian underpasses and
  overpasses. </p>
<p>Property owners are required by Municipal By-laws to clear snow adjacent to their
  property (residential or commercial). </p>
Property owners are required by <a href="pdf/SNOWREMOVALBROCHUREAmendedFeb0812.doc">Municipal Bylaws (No. 9166) </a> to clear snow from sidewalks adjacent to their property.
<h3>Bus Shelters</h3>
Bus Shelters are cleared by the Municipality on a priority basis.
<h3>Ice and Snow on Steep Streets</h3>
<p>In the event of a snowfall or when icy conditions prevail, steep streets may be temporarily
  barricaded to prevent their use.&nbsp; At the first opportunity the Municipality shall arrange to
  have the street plowed and/or salted. If street conditions remain unsafe despite these efforts
  or if adverse weather conditions continue, the temporary barricades may remain until such time
  as the street is deemed safe for use. </p>
<p>The above procedure must have the approval of the
  Director of Engineering or his designate prior to closure.</p>
