      <p>The Municipality is responsible for operating all traffic signals, including pedestrian
        crosswalk signals and intersection flashers. Our Municipality has 70 various traffic signals
        to serve the public roadways. </p>
      <p>These signals operate in a variety of ways. Most signals are "vehicle activated" which means the vehicle must stop at or near the stop line to activate it.      </p>
      <p> The crosswalks operate on a two phase system. Once the signal indicates "Walk", there is an
        8 second window to enter the crosswalk before the "Don't Walk" sign is lit. All signals have a
        clearance phase which allows sufficient time to complete your crossing. If you approach the
        intersection and there is no&quot;Walk&quot; signal lit, then it is unsafe to attempt to cross. </p>
      <p> There are <strong>pedestrian operated signals</strong> at some of the major crosswalk areas.
        These signals are operated solely by the pedestrian traffic in the area. They work when
        pedestrians press the buttons mounted on the nearby poles. If these signals don't operate when
        the buttons are pressed, a call to the Saanich electrical shop would be appreciated (250-475-5437). </p>
      <p> The other most important type of traffic signal is the <strong>fully actuated type</strong>.
        These signals are operated by both pedestrian and vehicle action. Although this type of signal
        is more complex than the pedestrian type, there are a few simple things to remember. </p>
      <p> Pedestrians only have to press the button once. This sends a signal to the controller where it
        is stored until the cycle is correct for allowing pedestrian movements across the
        intersection. The <strong>flashing &quot;Wait&quot; signal</strong> is called the pedestrian clear part of
        the cycle. This generally means that you must clear the crosswalk while this is flashing. A <strong>solid &quot;Wait</strong>&quot; means it is unsafe to cross as the light may be on the verge of
        changing. </p>
      <p> Motor vehicles trigger the lights in a similar way. Instead of pressing a button, they trigger
        a loop that is under the pavement. When a vehicle approaches an intersection it sends a signal
        via the loop to the controller, which in turn logs a call to the computer in the cabinet. It
        is important to remember to <strong>stop at the stop bar</strong>. If the vehicle stops too
        far behind or in front of the painted stop bar, it may not send a signal to the controller and
        you may miss your opportunity to advance through the intersection. </p>
