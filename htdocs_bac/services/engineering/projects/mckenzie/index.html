      <p>The District of Saanich is planning to upgrade McKenzie avenue from Shelbourne Street to Finnerty Road and Sinclair Road from Finnerty Road to Cadboro Bay Road in the coming years. These upgrades are intended to create a new sustainable multi-user corridor which improves overall safety and operating efficiency for all modes of transportation and also enhances aesthetics. This work will be undertaken in four phases. </p>
      <h2><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></h2>
      <p>In 2002 the District of Saanich and the University of Victoria began the development of a conceptual road design for Mckenzie Avenue from McGill Road to Haro Road. The intention was to accommodate the growth of the campus and meet the Districts need for sustainable roadways. </p>
      <p>Keeping in mind the demographics of the University and the needs of the community, a plan has been created which includes bike lanes, sidewalks, storm water management, and a traffic roundabout at the intersection of McKenzie Avenue and Finnerty Road. This plan encourages bike and pedestrian use, while minimizing delay to buses and vehicle traffic and uses landscaped areas to address storm water runoff and to soften the landscape.</p>

      <p> <a href="documents/McKenziePhaseOne-GHRDtoMcGill.pdf">Phase One</a>        <strong>Construction Saanich crews to return October 2013</strong> </p>
      <p>This phase of the McKenzie Upgrade project is from approximately 180m west of Gordon Head Road to the <a href="http://saanich.ca/services/engineering/projects/mckenzie/index.html">University</a> of Victoria entrance at McGill Road. This phase will include the addition of buffered bike lanes in both directions, sidewalk upgrades, bus stop improvements, enhanced intersection geometry to provide better access to the University and overall user safety.</p>

      <p><a href="documents/McKenziePhaseTwo-CARSAtoFinnerty.pdf">Phase Two - Drawing B </a> <strong>Construction is currently underway</strong> </p>
      <p><strong><u>McCoy Road Pedestrian Facility Upgrade</u> - Construction is planned to begin October Access will be maintained during construction, expect delays.</strong></p>
      <p>This phase phase of the Mckenzie Avenue Upgrade project spans from McGill Road to 100m past Finnerty Road. This phase will include the addition of buffered bike lanes, landscaped medians, multi-use path upgrades, improved intersection geometry, a roundabout at the Intersection of  Finnerty Road, an access point to the CARSA facility, and a bio-retention rain garden to provide storm water management and treatment to road runoff.</p>
      <p>The District of Saanich has awarded the contract to G&amp;E Contracting to complete Phase 2 of the McKenzie Road Upgrades.</p>
      <p>The project traffic management plan has the following key points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The work will be done while maintaining two lane traffic or single lane alternating traffic as applicable. Expect Delays</li>
        <li>Public transit will not be affected adversely. All efforts will be made to prioritize transit access to maintain service schedules. Contact BCTransit 250-382-6161 for information on routes, schedules, and other transit info.</li>
        <li>Pedestrian and cycling traffic will be allowed outside the construction zone. Crossing points are outlined. Obey all traffic control personnel.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Current construction schedule indicated completion of this phase November 2013</strong></p>
      <p><a href="documents/McKenziePhaseThree-TuscanytoGHRD.pdf">Phase Three</a> <strong>Construction is planned to begin October 2013</strong></p>
      <p>This phase of the McKenzie Avenue Upgrade project is from Shelbourn Street to 180m West of Gordon Head Road. The project will include the extension of the buffered bike lanes, landscaped median island, improved sidewalks, and the removal of a west-bound vehicle lane. </p>
      <p><strong><u>Phase Four</u></strong> -- Concept drawings in progress.</p>
      <p>This phase of the Sinclair Road Upgrade project is from 100m east of Finnerty Road to Cadboro Bay Road. The upgrade will include the extension of bike facilities, sidewalks, and improved driveway access. </p>
      <p>Once the concepts are refined for this phase, Saanich Engineering will consult with the public and community again. We anticipate this consultation in late 2013 or early 2014 with construction being undertaken in 2014 or 2015. </p>
