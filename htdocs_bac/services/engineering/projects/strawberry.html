      <h2>Update - May 4, 2010</h2>
      <p> Saanich Municipal Council has deliberated on the Interurban-Wilkinson project and has decided
        not to implement major changes at this time. It was accepted that the monies related to this
        project should be used at or near the intersection. These funds are development related (not
        tax payer funds) and must be used primarily to improve traffic operations at the
        Interurban-Wilkinson intersection. </p>
      <p>In doing so, Saanich will move forward with plans to implement the following:</p>
      <ol id="spaced">
        <li> Provide a concrete median on the Interurban approach to Wilkinson from the stop bar past
          the gas bar and Knockanback Grill driveway to prevent illegal left turn movement into or
          out of these driveways. </li>
        <li> Provide a right turn bay on both Interurban approaches to Wilkinson at the most
          advantageous time (when redevelopment or rezoning occurs), or when funds become available. </li>
        <li> Provide a sidewalk on the north side of Interurban from Roy Road to the existing
          accessible bus stop to the east. This will allow the removal of the bus stop on Interurban
          westbound at Roy Road. </li>
        <li>Provide bike lane markings where available and in conjunction with any new designs.</li>
      </ol>
      <p> The Municipality of Saanich is committed to balanced transportation and continues to look for
        ways to improve transit service to this area. </p>
      <p> The sidewalk along Santa Anita is a separate, though related, project and will be constructed
        in 2010 to provide a complete pedestrian sidewalk from Hastings to Wilkinson. </p>

      <p> Saanich is currently reviewing some key items that were voiced at the latest community
        meetings. These include: a review of time restricted closure of Hastings through and left
        approach; construction phasing to leave some items unconstructed until necessary (if at all),
        review how large vehicles will get through the detour routes (dump trucks with trailers (60ft
        long), trucks with horse trailers, etc). Decisions will be made by the end of the month and
        they will be posted here as well as sent to the Community Association and residents via
        representatives. For any further information please contact Paul Butterfield at
        Paul.Butterfield@saanich.ca or 250-475-5494 ext 3439.</p>
