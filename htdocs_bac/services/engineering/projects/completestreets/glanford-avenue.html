      <h2>About</h2>
      <p> <a href="documents/GlanfordAveKeyMap.pdf"><img src="images/clip_image002_003.jpg" alt="Project Area" width="188" height="427" border="0" class="float-right"></a> </p>
      <p>The area of interest for this project is a 2.0km stretch of Glanford Avenue between Vanalman Avenue and Ralph Street within the District of Saanich. This stretch is a major road that provides access to the business parks north of the project and Mckenzie Avenue south of the project. In addition, Glanford Avenue provides access to commercial sites, institutional sites such as Glanford Middle School, several parks and residential properties.</p>
      <p>This section of Glanford Avenue is within the <a href="../../../../business/lap/carey.html">Carey Local Area Plan</a> - a plan that will help guide the future of this neighbourhood. Based on this plan, the overall &quot;community vision&quot; in this area is one that utilizes social and environmental criteria for major roads in the neighbourhood. This includes providing safe access to pedestrian and cycling facilities near highways, businesses and schools; preserving and enhancing the passive and active recreation opportunities offered within parks; and maintaining nearby environmental attributes such as Gary Oak meadows and Colquitz River tributaries</p>
      <p>The new design of Glanford Avenue will meet the needs of motorists, cyclists and pedestrians of all ages, as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving storm water quality. The new design will improve safety, be more inviting for all users of the Glanford Avenue corridor and reflect the neighbourhood vision as defined in the Carey Local Area Plan.</p>
      <p>Please visit this page in the future for more information on this project. The District of Saanich will update this page when project milestones, concept designs and open house dates become finalized. </p>

      <p>With the help of the Red Barn Market, the District of Saanich have installed a sounding board outside of their Glanford Avenue store. As sounding boards are meant to be interactive to the public, this location was chosen in an effort to expose the project to the most people local to Glanford Avenue, onsite.</p>
