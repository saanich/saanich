      <h2>About</h2>
      <p><a href="documents/CookStKeyMap.pdf"><img src="images/clip_image002_001.jpg" alt="Project Area" width="266" height="261" border="0" class="float-right"></a>Cook Street is a 0.9km major road within the District of Saanich, providing access to several commercial sites at the northwest end and residential properties southwards. This section of Cook Street is within the <a href="http://saanich.ca/business/lap/quadra.html">Quadra Local Area Plan</a> - a plan that will help guide the future of this neighbourhood.  Based on this plan, the overall &quot;community vision&quot; is one that is vibrant and inclusive for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians; one that is safe, providing a continuous network of routes connecting neighbourhoods, parks, trails, commercial and institutional facilities; and one that protects and enhances urban forests, wildlife and parks.</p>
      <p>The new design of Cook Street will meet the needs of motorists, cyclists and pedestrians of all ages, as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving storm water quality. The new design will improve safety, be more inviting for all users of the Cook Street corridor and reflect the neighbourhood vision as defined in the Quadra Local Area Plan.</p>
      <p>Please visit this page in the future for more information on this project. The District of Saanich will update this page when project milestones, concept designs and open house dates become finalized. </p>
