      <p>Creation of a Local Area Service allows for the installation of a service that directly
        benefits a distinct area of Saanich, and to have the service paid for in whole or in part by
        those who directly benefit. </p>
      <p> These services are usually ones that do not meet normal municipal criteria for funded capital
        works, yet are sufficiently desired by the residents.  Examples of such services are:
        sidewalks on residential roads, storm drains, street lighting, underground power lines, and
        watermains. </p>
      <p> Local Area Services may be initiated by Saanich, but are usually initiated by residents using
        a petition process set out in the Community Charter.  Residents interested in initiating a
        Local Area Service are encouraged to contact the Engineering Department for advice and
        assistance right from the beginning. </p>
      <h2>Petition Process</h2>
      
      <p>In general terms, a petition must be signed by more than 50% of the benefiting property
							owners, representing more than 50% of the total assessed values for land and improvements of
							the benefiting properties.  The Municipality determines which properties will benefit from the
							Local Area Service. </p>
      <h2>Cost Recovery</h2>

      <p>Saanich recovers some or all of the costs of  Local Area Services, based on the class of
							service, and has determined which services will be paid for on a parcel basis and which will
							be paid for on a frontage basis.      </p>

<h2>Local Service Taxes</h2>

If a Local Area Service is created, the costs to be recovered from each benefiting property
							are considered Local Service Taxes.  The taxes may be paid at the first instance when the
							service is installed, or they may be included on the annual property tax notice for a number
							of years, typically 15-20.  Interest rates on the costs are established by the province on an
							annual basis.
</p>
<p> If you have any questions regarding the Local Area Services please contact the Engineering
  Department at 250-475-5575. </p>
