      <p>When a fire occurs, there is no time for planning. So sit down with your family today and make
        a step-by-step plan for escaping a fire. </p>
      <h2>Know 2 Ways Out</h2>
      <p> Draw a diagram of your home, showing every door and window. Plan two ways out of every room,
        especially the bedrooms. Then walk through each escape route, checking for barriers. Make sure
        everyone can unlock all locks and open all windows and doors quickly, even in the dark. </p>
      <h2>Escape a 2 Story House</h2>
      <p> If you must escape from a second-storey window, be sure you have a safe way to reach the
        ground. Make special arrangements for small children and people with disabilities. </p>
      <h2>Get Out Fast</h2>
      <p> In case of a fire, don't stop for anything. Do not try to take possessions or pets. Just get
        out. Call the fire department from a neighbour's phone after you are out. </p>
      <h2>Do Not Go Back</h2>
      <p> Make sure everyone in your family knows that once they are out, they must not go back for any
        reason. If people are trapped, firefighters have the best chance of rescuing them. </p>
      <h2>Call the Fire Department After You Escape</h2>
      <p> Everyone should gather at one meeting place outside, preferably at the front, where the fire
        department will arrive. Each family member should know how to place an emergency 9-1-1
        telephone call from a neighbour's home. </p>
      <h2>Practice Your Plan</h2>
      <p> At least twice a year, have a fire drill in your home. Appoint someone as the monitor, to
        sound the alarm and make sure everyone participates. </p>
      <p> The majority of fatal fires occur when people are sleeping. So start the drill, go to your
        bedroom, close the door, and wait for the monitor to sound the alarm. </p>
      <p> Make your exit drill as realistic as possible. Practice both escape routes. Pretend that
        certain exits are blocked by fire, that there are no lights, and that the hallways are filling
        with smoke. </p>
      <p> Remember, a fire drill is not a race. Get out quickly, but carefully. </p>
      <h2>Be Ready for Hazards on the Way Out</h2>
      <p> <strong>Test Every Door</strong> - Before opening a door, make sure there is no fire on the
        other side. Kneeling or crouching at the door, reach up high and use the back of your hand to
        touch the door, the door knob, and the space between the door and the frame. If any of these
        feels hot, use your second way out. </p>
      <p> <strong>Crawl Low</strong> - Smoke contains deadly gases and is hot, so it will fill the room
        from the top down. If you encounter smoke using your primary exit, use your alternate route
        instead. If you must exit through smoke, the best air will be several inches off the floor.
        Get down on your hands and knees, and crawl quickly to the exit. </p>
