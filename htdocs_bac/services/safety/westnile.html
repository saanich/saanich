      <p> <img src="../../images/services/safety/wn_update.jpg" alt="" class="float-right"> West Nile Virus is spread to people by a few different species of mosquitoes only after they
        have fed on the blood of infected birds. It first appeared in North America in 1999. In
        Canada, the virus has been found in Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. </p>
      <p> Where it occurs, the risk of contracting West Nile Virus is highest during the mosquito season
        (mid-April through September); however the risk of becoming infected is very low. Most people
        that do contract West Nile Virus show no symptoms at all, while 20% will develop flu-like
        symptoms, and, in very rare cases (1%), the virus can cause severe illness. The best way to
        protect yourself and your family is to avoid mosquito bites if you are in a region where West
        Nile has been reported. </p>
      <p> As part of the monitoring process, please report dead birds on the <a
					    	href="http://westnile.bccdc.org/" target="_blank">West Nile website</a>. </p>
      <p> Many of the mosquitoes around us come from small sources of standing water around the home,
        and some mosquitoes even breed in the upper intertidal areas along our coast, so preventing
        mosquitoes from biting you is the most effective strategy. </p>
      <h2>Suggestions to protect yourself</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid the outdoors at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active.</li>
        <li>Protect yourself by wearing clothing to cover your arms and legs and wear a hat.</li>
        <li>Wear light coloured clothes because mosquitoes are attracted to dark clothing.</li>
        <li>Ensure door and window screens are effective in keeping mosquitoes outdoors.</li>
        <li>Use insect repellents when outdoors.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Reduce mosquito breeding areas around your home</h2>
      <p> <img src="../../images/services/safety/aedestogoi.gif" alt="" class="float-right"> Mosquitoes require standing water to lay their eggs in, and under ideal conditions, some
        mosquitoes can develop into adults in les than a week.  Even a small amount of standing water
        can provide breeding areas. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Empty standing water from things such as pool covers, saucers under gardening pots,
          buckets, recycling bins and garbage cans. </li>
        <li>Clear your property of unused items that could collect water (such as old tires).</li>
        <li> Change water twice a week in items such as bird baths, pet bowls, wading pools and
          livestock watering tanks. </li>
        <li>Use screens to cover rain barrels.</li>
        <li>Clean eave troughs regularly to avoid standing water.</li>
        <li> Do not overwater lawns or wash cars in driveway - the water goes into the catch basins on
          your street, providing breeding habitat. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What do I do if I have a pond?</h2>
      <p> A healthy wetland with native aquatic plants and insects will produce very few mosquitoes, so
        nothing should be done to upset the balance. If you have a small pond, or a pond that is not a
        balanced ecosystem, there are still a few options available. </p>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li> Purchase an aerator or pump that will keep the surface water moving, making the pond
          unsuitable for egg-laying by mosquitoes and unwelcoming to mosquito larvae. </li>
        <li>Attract mosquito predators to your yard such as bats, swallows, or dragonflies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> If your wetland is natural, or is connected to a natural waterway such as a creek or lake, it
        is illegal to put fish in it. Be sure to contact the proper authorities for advice before
        introducing fish. </p>
      <h2>Can I use pesticides?</h2>
      <p> <img src="../../images/services/safety/tarsalis.gif" alt="" class="float-right"> For the health of the environment and your family, pesticide use is not recommended. As a
        first step, you should try to eliminate all standing water on your property, and allow your
        ponds to reach a natural state of balance. You can do a search for evidence of breeding
        mosquitoes, as the larvae are very easy to spot. Look for small aquatic insects that suspend
        themselves just under the surface of your pond, and wiggle below if you disturb them (image).
        Many of your mosquitoes may be coming from off-site, especially if you live near the ocean,
        so be sure to first check your ponds for the tell-tale larvae and remember that natural
        wetlands have very few mosquitoes. </p>
      <p> Concerns over the use of pesticides are that they effect non-target organisms, and can
        possibly create new, and sometimes more-hospitable, breeding habitat. Mosquitoes may also
        develop a resistance to the pesticides in use. </p>
      <p> Pesticide control for mosquitoes targets the immature life-stages, which are confined to
        water. This can be done manually or by using bacterial or chemical larvicides. Adult flying
        mosquitoes cannot be controlled. To manually remove mosquito larvae we suggest using a small
        gauge aquarium net to scoop the wriggling insects at the water&rsquo;s surface, or you can also
        temporarily drain the water source, but remember that mosquitoes are very quick to
        re-colonize an area. </p>
      <h2>What can a homeowner do?</h2>
      <p> Commercial pesticides can only be applied by certified pesticide applicators. If you find
        water containing mosquito larvae on your property, and you can&rsquo;t empty or strain the area,
        there are some options for the homeowner.  Biological larvicides are available from your
        local home-and-garden centre. These contain naturally occurring bacteria (Bacillus
        thuringiensis israelensis) which target all species of aquatic flies. Using a pesticide of
        any type in a pond or wetland disrupts the normal balance of predators and prey (the web of
        life), so it should not be used in healthy ecosystems. Fully 10% of all flies are aquatic in
        their larval stage, and many of them are food for other animals such as dragonflies, birds,
        amphibians, fish and bats. Some flies are even predators of mosquitoes. </p>
      <h2>What is Bti?</h2>
      <p> <img src="../../images/services/safety/larvae.gif" alt="" class="float-right"> <em>Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis</em> (Bti) is a naturally occurring soil bacterium that
        is being applied as a biological pest control agent to areas of standing water where
        mosquitoes breed. Bti produces a protein crystal that, once ingested by the feeding larvae,
        kills all flies by damaging their digestive system so that they can&rsquo;t feed and they die within
        days. Bti has been used since 1982, and Health Canada has determined that it poses little
        threat to human health, and it only affects aquatic flies. </p>
      <p> The weight of scientific evidence indicates that Bti is non-infectious and non-toxic to humans
        and other mammals, and poses little risk at dosage levels permitted in insect control
        programs. It should be noted however, that mosquitoes can develop resistance to it over time,
        and when used on a healthy wetland ecosystem the effect can be the opposite of what you would
        like by creating a predator-free environment that new mosquitoes can colonize. As with all
        pesticides, Bti should be used with caution. </p>

      <h2>Saanich's Response to West Nile Virus</h2>
      <p> Since 2003, Saanich has been preparing for the potential arrival of west Nile Virus by
        surveying and mapping the breeding grounds of mosquito species that can carry the virus.
        A West Nile Virus Response Plan was completed in 2007. </p>
