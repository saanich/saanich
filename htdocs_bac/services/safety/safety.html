      <h2>General Safety Tips</h2>
      <p> If electrical systems and equipment are not well-maintained, they become fire hazards. Follow
        these safety tips to prevent electrical fires: </p>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li> Immediately replace any electrical cords that are cracked or frayed or that get hot during
          use. </li>
        <li>Don't overload electrical outlets or extension cords.</li>
        <li>If appliances aren't working right, have them repaired by a qualified professional.</li>
        <li> Disconnect any electrical device if you feel a tingle when you touch it, if it emits a
          burning smell, or if it blows a fuse. </li>
        <li>Be sure all your electrical appliances are ULC labelled.</li>
        <li> If a fuse blows or a circuit breaker trips in your home, try to find out why. Make sure the
          new fuse is the right size and amperage. Fuses and circuit breakers protect you; don't tamper
          with them. </li>
        <li> If there are small children in your home, insert plastic child protector covers into
          electrical outlets. </li>
        <li> Prevent shocks. Make sure your hands are dry and do not stand in or near water when using
          appliances such as hair dryers. Unplug them after use. If the inside of an appliance gets
          wet, have it serviced before using it again. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Kitchen</h2>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li>Never leave cooking unattended.</li>
        <li>Keep your stove and oven clean.</li>
        <li>Wear close-fitting sleeves when cooking.</li>
        <li>Do not hang curtains or store things over the stove.</li>
        <li> Turn pot handles inward so they can't be knocked off the stove or pulled down by small
          children. </li>
        <li> If a grease fire starts, carefully slide a lid over the pan to smother the flames, and
          turn off the burner. Never pour water on a grease fire. </li>
        <li>Never leave pot holders on the stove.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Sleeping Areas</h2>
      <p> The majority of fatal home fires happen while people are sleeping. So it is extremely
        important to install smoke alarms and to practice <a href="escape.html">family escape
          drills</a>. </p>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li>Never smoke in bed.</li>
        <li> Install smoke alarms on every level of your home (including the basement) and especially
          outside every sleeping area. Make sure everyone can hear and recognize the alarm's sound.
          If you sleep with bedroom doors closed, install alarms inside bedrooms, as well. </li>
        <li> <a href="escape.html">Plan and practice two escape routes</a> from each room. If one way
          out leads through a window above the first floor, make sure you have a way to reach the
          ground safely. </li>
        <li> Make sure everyone in your family knows the home escape plan, the meeting place, and the
          phone number of the fire department (9-1-1), which they should call from a neighbour's
          phone, after escaping from the building. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Basement or Garage</h2>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li> If you keep gasoline on hand, store it outside your home or in a detached garage. Keep
        only small quantities, and use a ULC-listed gasoline safety can. </li>
        <li> Always store paint and other flammable liquids in their original labelled containers with
          tight-fitting lids. </li>
        <li> Use and store flammable liquids well away from appliances, heaters, pilot lights,
          cigarettes, and other sources of heat. </li>
        <li>Have your furnace checked every year by a professional.</li>
        <li>Remove trash from your home. Don't store anything near the furnace or heater.</li>
        <li> Never use gasoline to start a barbeque or campfire. Keep barbeques outside of homes, and
          away from overhangs and combustibles. </li>
        <li> Before starting your lawnmower, snowblower or motorcycle, move it away from gasoline
          fumes. Let the motor cool before you refuel. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Living & Family Rooms</h2>
      <ul id="spaced">
        <li> Use extreme caution with cigarettes! Provide large, deep ashtrays for smokers. Check for
          smouldering cigarettes under cushions of couches and chairs before you go to bed or leave
        your home. </li>
        <li> Keep portable space heaters at least 1 metre (3 feet) away from anything that can burn.
          Always turn heaters off when you go to bed or go out. Never leave children alone in a room
          with a portable heater or woodstove operating. </li>
        <li>Use a metal screen on your fireplace.</li>
        <li>Have your chimney professionally checked once a year and cleaned when necessary.</li>
        <li> Use only the correct fuel for heat: aged wood in fireplaces and woodstoves and only
          kerosene in kerosene heaters. Refuel a heater in a well-ventilated area, after the heater
          has cooled. </li>
        <li> Keep lighters and matches up high, preferably in a locked cabinet, where young children
          can't see or reach them. </li>
        <li>Make sure TVs and stereos have space around them to prevent overheating.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Prevent Fires Caused by Heating </h2>
      <h3>Space Heaters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Space heaters need space. Keep them at least three feet away from things that can burn, such as curtains or stacks of newspaper. Always turn off heaters when leaving the room or going to bed.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Furnaces</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Have a service person inspect chimneys, fireplaces, wood and coal stoves and central furnaces once a year. Have them cleaned when necessary.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Fireplaces and Wood Stoves</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep things that can burn away from your fireplace and keep a glass or metal screen in front of your fireplace. Creosote logs can be used to help reduce the build-up of creosote in fireplaces. Check labels to make sure the log has been tested and approved by UL. Even if you use creosote logs, fireplaces should still be inspected by a professional each year.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Prevent Fires Caused by Candles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Only light candles when an adult is in the room. Do not allow children to keep candles or incense in their rooms. Always use stable, candle holders made of material that won't catch fire, such as metal, glass, etc.&nbsp; Blow out candles when adults leave the room.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Fire Safety in Wildland/Urban Interface Areas</h2>
      <p>Saanich has many areas where the wilderness and urban development meet. This means that structures and vegetation are sufficiently close together that a wildfire may spread between trees or vegetation and structures easily.</p>
      <p>Our ability to live more safely in this environment depends upon everyone taking steps to reduce the risk of a forest fire becoming an urban fire.&nbsp; Some factors that may influence the fire environment are: weather, topography/slope, available fuel and human activities. By being aware of these factors and following this list of recommendations you can assist in reducing the risks of damage and increase the chance that your home will survive a wildfire.</p>
      <h3><strong>Reduce Your Risk From Wildfire &ndash; Information for Residents</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Manage the risk and reduce the amount of fuel present - prune shrubs, remove all dead and dry vegetation and tree limbs 2 - 3 metres from the ground. &nbsp;Prior to cutting consult the Saanich Tree Preservation Bylaw at: 


        <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/parkrec/parks/trees/bylaw.html">http://www.saanich.ca/parkrec/parks/trees/bylaw.html</a> </li>
        <li>Plant more fire resistant vegetation around your house or other structures. </li>
        <li>Relocate firewood and other combustible debris at least 10 metres away from your home. </li>
        <li>Know the exit routes from your neighbourhood and be prepared to use an alternate route if necessary. </li>
        <li>If you are replacing your roof, siding or decking, consider a limited combustible or fire resistant product. </li>
        <li>Keep the roof and gutters clear of dead needles and other accumulations such as dead leaves; prune all branches that hang over the roof. </li>
        <li>Adhere to local bylaws, which outline rules for outdoor burning at <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/services/safety/outdoor.html">http://www.saanich.ca/services/safety/outdoor.html</a>. </li>
      </ul>

      <h2><strong>Barbecue with care</strong></h2>
      <p>Barbecuing is an enjoyable activity during the warmer seasons, but this enjoyment can turn to disaster unless proper safety precautions are taken.&nbsp; Follow these safety tips to ensure a safe and enjoyable barbecuing season.</p>
      <h3><strong>Gas barbecues</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow the manufacturer's instructions when fitting the gas cylinder to the barbecue. Use proper wrenches to tighten connections. </li>
        <li>If your barbecue connection area has an &quot;o&quot; ring, check it every time you connect the cylinder. Replace missing, cracked or damaged &quot;o&quot; rings.</li>
        <li>After connecting the gas supply hose to the barbecue, open the propane cylinder or natural gas supply valve. Check for gas leaks by applying a soapy solution over the connections and hose. Soap bubbles will form if there is a leak.</li>
        <li>If a leak or fire occurs, turn off gas supply valve immediately.</li>
        <li>If using a match, always light the match before turning on the gas to prevent an excessive gas build up. If the barbecue is equipped with an electronic igniter, follow directions on the control panel.</li>
        <li>Always ensure that the cylinder valves are fully open or fully closed.</li>
        <li>Prevent grease from dripping onto the hoses or cylinder as grease build up could be a potential fire hazard.</li>
        <li>Ensure all valves are turned off when the barbecue is not in use.</li>
        <li>Do not store cylinders indoors.</li>
        <li>Always ignite the barbeque with the lid open.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><strong>Charcoal barbecues</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use only an approved fire starter fluid designed for barbecue grills. Do NOT use gasoline. Store the remaining fire starter fluid in a safe place.</li>
        <li>Be sure that fire starter fluids are not accessible to children as they are poisonous when swallowed. Special childproof caps are available at your local dealer. Solid fuel fire starters or electric fire starters are also available.</li>
        <li>Prevent fire hazards by keeping the barbecuing area free of twigs, dried leaves, and paper products such as paper cups, plates, and napkins.</li>
        <li>Before disposing charcoal ash, ensure it is thoroughly extinguished. Live coals or hot embers can start a fire &ldquo;be extremely cautious!</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><strong>General information</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>All barbeque grills must only be used outdoors &mdash; using grills indoors or in enclosed spaces is not only a fire hazard, but it exposes occupants to toxic gasses.</li>
        <li>Always position the grill well away from combustible objects &mdash; buildings, fences, deck railings and landscaping can easily and quickly ignite.</li>
        <li>Never leave a lit grill unattended.</li>
        <li>Always use long handled grilling utensils and heat resistant oven mitts to avoid exposure burns from heat and flames.</li>
        <li>Periodically remove grease build-up in catch trays to prevent it from igniting.</li>
        <li>Keep a garden hose nearby, connected and ready for use in case of a fire.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><strong>Fire safety in our parks</strong></h2>
      <p>Saanich Fire and Saanich Parks and Recreation work together in a coordinated approach to protect our urban forest, especially heavily treed parks, through fire prevention, suppression, and preparation. </p>
      <p>While many of us enjoy a warm, dry summer, this weather increases the fire hazard in our parks. Residents and visitors play an important role in fire prevention and detection. Here are some tips for keeping our parks fire safe in any season:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Look for Fire Danger Rating signs in Mount Doug and Mount Tolmie parks, or at one of the three fire stations (760 Vernon Avenue, 4595 Elk Lake Drive, 1900 McKenzie Avenue).</li>
        <li>Watch for increases in fire hazard ratings and obey any posted notices. </li>
        <li>When fire hazard ratings are extreme, stay on trails and avoid using barbecues, even in permitted areas. </li>
        <li>Do not park on or right next to dry grass.</li>
        <li>If you smoke, take extra care to properly extinguish and dispose of your cigarette litter.</li>
        <li>If you spot a fire, smell or see smoke, immediately call 9-1-1 and report your location</li>
        <li>Campfires are prohibited in our parks and beaches.</li>
        <li>Beach fires are prohibited in Saanich. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><strong>Picnic and Barbecue Guidelines</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Barbecuing is permitted in Saanich parks.</li>
        <li>We recommend the use of propane fuelled grills.&nbsp; </li>
        <li>If you use a charcoal or hibachi grill, extinguish coals with water, wrap with foil and pack them out for deposit in a metal container. Do not dump coals and ash onto the ground, into a Lake or at the base of a tree.</li>
        <li>Never barbecue under a tree. Do not use a trash barrel as a stand. Do not move picnic tables.</li>
        <li>Be considerate of others and respect the beauty of your natural surroundings.</li>
      </ul>
