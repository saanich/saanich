      <p>The objective of the Risk Management Division is to protect
        the Municipality's assets, employees, volunteers and citizens
        from loss, damage or injury through the promotion of policies
        and procedures designed to prevent incidents from occurring.
        As well, the Division attempts to effectively reduce the
        effects of incidents which do occur through various methods
        of loss reduction, risk transfer and risk financing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="documents/RiskManagementClaimForm.pdf">Claim Form </a><a target="_blank" href="pdf/claimform.pdf"><img src="/images/logos/pdf.gif" alt="PDF document" width="19" height="16"></a></li>

      </ul>
      <p>        The Division is responsible for recommending, selecting and
        purchasing all insurance necessary to sustain the Municipality's
        ability to deliver services to its taxpayers. The Municipality
        does not carry general liability insurance in the same way
        that a homeowner or business operator does. Rather it operates
        with large retentions (or deductibles) and therefore most
        losses are effectively self-insured. </p>
      <p>The Division is also responsible for the claims management
        function for the Municipality. It investigates and adjusts
        all claims filed by citizens or businesses who allege that
        they have suffered damage or injury as a result of a negligent
        act or omission by the Municipality or its employees.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>If a person feels that the Municipality is responsible for
        any damage or injury sustained and wishes to make a claim,
        they are required, under Section 286 of the <em>Local Government
          Act</em>, to provide notice to the Municipality in writing
        of the time, place and manner in which the damage was sustained,
        within two months of the date the loss or damage occurred. </p>
      <p> If you are unsure about how to file a claim, would like a claim form mailed or faxed to you, or have filed a claim and have questions about the investigation or status of the claim, please call the Risk Management Division at 250-475-5455 from Monday to Friday, between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.&nbsp;Please note that depending on the type of claim, it may take several weeks for a determination to be made about your claim.&nbsp; Please be patient. </p>
      <p>        If you wish to submit a claim, please fill out the <a href="documents/RiskManagementClaimForm.pdf" target="_blank">claim form</a><img src="/images/logos/pdf.gif" alt="PDF document" width="19" height="16">, sign and date the form, attach all supporting documents and submit to the attention of the Risk Manager via:</p>
      <p><u>Regular Mail:</u> <br>
        District of Saanich<br>
        770 Vernon Avenue<br>
      Victoria, BC V8W 2W7</p>
      <p><u>Fax:<br>
      </u>250-475-5429</p>
<p>        Once a claim is received, it is then acknowledged, investigated
        and responded to with either an acceptance or denial of liability.
        If a person wishes to appeal a denial of their claim they
        may do so through either the Small Claims Court or Supreme
        Court of BC. </p>
      <p>        Please note that the Municipality is not an insurer of private
        property. The Municipality will not be held responsible for
        your damages unless you can provide evidence that the Municipality
        committed a negligent act or omission which then caused the
        damages. Like most Canadian Municipalities, the District
        of Saanich provides compensation only when it is legally
        liable for the damage sustained. The intent is to provide
        an equitable policy for the taxpaying public, who ultimately
        bear the cost of these claims. </p>
      <p>If you have insurance coverage, you are required to submit your claim for damages 
        to your insurance company first, and your insurance company
        may then submit your claim to the Municipality. </p>
      <h3><a name="sewer" id="sewer"></a>SEWER &amp; DRAIN
        BACKUPS&nbsp;</h3>
      <p>The most common causes of sewer and drain backups: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Putting items down your drain that should be put into
          your garbage </li>
        <li>Invasive tree roots </li>
        <li>Pipe problems </li>
        <li>Storms </li>
        <li>Vandalism </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is the Homeowner's responsibility to determine where a
        blockage in the system is located, regardless if it is on
        private or public property. If you are experiencing a backup,
        a plumber should be called to determine the location of the
        blockage. If it is determined that the blockage is on Municipal
        property, the Public Works Department should then immediately
        be contacted and the plumber should stay on site. </p>
      <h2><a name="water" id="water"></a>Water Main Breaks</h2>
      <p>Water mains run underneath the roadway and supply fresh water
        to the private services connected to it. The private service
        brings water from the water main to your building, and is
        the owner's responsibility. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>If there is water gushing out of the street, a water main
        or water pipe has probably broken on the street. Please contact
        the Public Works Department immediately at 250-475-5599 or at the <a href="#Emergencynumbers">after hour emergency numbers</a> above.
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>If there is a water leak at the meter box, please call Public
        Works, who will then attend and advise whether the leak is
        on public or private property. </p>
      <h2><a name="owner" id="owner"></a>Homeowner Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>The Homeowner is responsible to take the first steps to minimize
        any damage to personal property (i.e. remove undamaged items
        from the area to prevent damages). </p>
      <p>Notify your Homeowner or Rental Insurance Agent of the damage
        as soon as possible to determine if your policy provides
        coverage for the damage. </p>
      <p>Take immediate steps, through your own resources or those
        of your Insurer, to remove excess water or sewage ASAP. Sewage
        presents special health considerations so you may need professional
        assistance. Damage restoration firms are listed in the phone
        directory. </p>
      <p>Common sense will dictate most other actions. Remember that
        electricity and water can prove fatal <strong>BE CAREFUL </strong></p>
      <h2><a name="potholes" id="potholes"></a>Potholes &amp; Road Hazards</h2>
      <p>If you have damaged your vehicle because of a pothole:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>See a licensed motor vehicle mechanic. </li>
        <li>Do not continue to drive your vehicle if it is not operating
          properly. </li>
        <li>Note the exact location of the pothole and report it
          to the Municipal Roads Department so that they can take
          steps to fix the road. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may wish to contact your insurance provider as there
        may be coverage for this type of loss. </p>
