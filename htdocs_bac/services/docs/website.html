      <h2>Update</h2>
      <h3>New Homepage       </h3>
      <p>The District of Saanich is pleased to launch a new website homepage on Friday, July 27th 2012.&nbsp; Saanich conducted a brief survey in June 2011, to gather opinions about the current municipal website.&nbsp; The majority of survey respondents felt that the website was not seen as requiring many improvements, additions or changes.&nbsp; Only two items were cited by more than 5% of respondents, namely that navigation should be improved and that the site should be made cleaner, clearer and/or less cluttered.</p>
      <p>In response to these suggestions we have made some changes.&nbsp; A simpler navigation design has been incorporated into the new homepage.&nbsp; We have integrated website standards, best practices, and have tried to make the home page less cluttered.</p>
      <p>This is the first of many changes that you will see over time to the Saanich website.&nbsp; If you have questions or feedback please contact <a href="mailto:norma.louden@saanich.ca">norma.louden@saanich.ca</a>, Corporate Projects Coordinator at 250-475-5494 ext. 3444. </p>
      <h2>Survey Results
      </h2>
      <p> One of our strategic plan initiatives this year is to engage citizens to determine
        what they want in a Municipal website. In June, 2011 Saanich conducted a brief
        website survey to gather opinions about the current municipal website, social
        media preferences and to seek participants for technology focus groups. </p>
      <p> The survey was well publicized, through the Saanich News, various websites,
        Community Associations, Facebook, Twitter and our Youth Council. Uptake was
        low with 277 individuals completing the questionnaire; however 50 respondents
        indicated their interest in participating in future technology focus group sessions. </p>
      <p> A summary of the findings include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Saanich's website is on par with other government sites.</li>
        <li> There were very few suggestions for improvement or addition to the website.
          The most frequent suggestion was to improve navigation. </li>
        <li> Approximately 40% of the respondents currently use social media - primarily
          for keeping in touch with family and friends. </li>
        <li>There does not appear to be a strong demand for applications for mobile devices.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong><a href="pdf/website_survey_results.pdf" target="_blank">Detailed result</a></strong> PDF</p>
      <p>The responses received will be used to help guide our planning for future
        changes to the website. This survey is one part of a series of initiatives to explore
        the design of the next municipal web platform. In this regard, work has recently
        commenced to develop a plan for the Saanich website which includes the use of
        social media tools.</p>
      <p>As a direct follow up to this survey, we may conduct additional focus groups to
        develop and test ideas for improvements to the existing website and
        development of the future platform.</p>
      <p>Coming soon will be a survey for local business to give feedback on the Saanich
        website. That survey will be released in the last quarter of 2011.</p>
      <p>Thank you for your continued interest in the Saanich website. If you have
        comments, please email <a href="mailto:debby.harris@saanich.ca">debby.harris@saanich.ca</a> in the Corporate Services
