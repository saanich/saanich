    <h2>2012 Business Survey </h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p> On April 3, 2012, a survey invitation was sent to 1,500 randomly selected Saanich businesses, asking them to share their ideas and opinions about Saanich as a place to do business, and how their municipal government could best serve their needs. Invitations were distributed as 1,000 sent by mail and 500 by email. By the April 13, 2012 response deadline, we had received 331 completed surveys and 31 undeliverable notifications, giving us a response rate of 22.5%.</p>
    <p>A similar survey sent to Saanich citizens in January 2012 received a 29% response rate and has been reported separately. Both sets of results will be used to guide planning and decision making. </p>
    <p> The complete report can be downloaded in PDF format below. The report is also available by
      contacting municipal staff at (250) 475-5415 or by <a href="mailto:lumj@saanich.ca">e-mail</a>. </p>
