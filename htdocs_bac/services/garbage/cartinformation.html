      <h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In Spring 2014, all garbage collection customers (single family dwellings and registered suites) will receive a kitchen container for daily collection of kitchen scraps, a green standard sized 120-litre organics recycling cart and a grey standard sized 180-litre garbage cart <span class="urgent">unless</span> smaller, larger or additional carts are selected.</strong></h3>
      <h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Watch your mailbox for information about Greener Garbage Collection, choose your cart sizes and register for the assistance program now</strong> <a href="documents/GreenerGarbageCollectionSecondMailoutCartSelection.pdf"><img width="19" height="16" src="images/clip_image001.gif" alt="PDF"></a>. 


      <strong>If you missed the July 5, 2013 deadline and would like carts other than the standard sizes, please contact us and let us know.</strong></h3>
      <h2><strong>Choose Carts That Best Work for You</strong></h2>
      <p>        Most households will find the standard sized 120-litre organics recycling cart and standard sized 180-litre garbage cart will best meet their needs. Cart size selections and fees are listed below. </p>
      <p><img src="images/CartCostTableforwebandcartphoto_004.png" width="960" height="363" alt="Carts"></p>
      <p>In 2013, Saanich garbage collection customers will pay $156 for solid waste services; this appears as a separate line item on property taxes. In 2014, this will be replaced with property owners paying an annual base fee of $105 for solid waste services plus an annual cart fee for their garbage and organics recycling carts. The carts are not being rented. The cart fees being charged cover the ongoing costs for disposal and processing of garbage and organics recycling collected in the carts at the Hartland landfill and compost facility.</p>
      <h2><strong>Things to Consider When Choosing Your Carts </strong></h2>
      <p>Garbage and organics recycling will be collected on the same day, every second week. </p>
      <p>Yard trimmings can be added to your organics recycling cart for collection too.</p>
      <p> If you do not have a backyard compost and visit the Garden Recycling Drop-off, you may wish to consider the large 240-litre organics recycling cart and avoid waiting in line.</p>
      <p>If you are an avid recycler, have a backyard compost and currently have a small amount of garbage, the small 80-litre organics recycling and 120-litre garbage cart may be a good option for you.</p>
      <p>If you have a large family or often need extra bags of  garbage picked up, you may consider choosing a standard 120-litre organics recycling cart, a standard 180-litre garbage cart and perhaps an additional garbage cart.</p>
      <p>Carts will be delivered to households in Spring 2014 and include a kitchen container for daily collection of kitchen scraps, a supply of compostable bags and information on curbside  cart placement and recycling tips. </p>
      <h2><strong>Cart Size Exchanges</strong></h2>
      <p> In Spring 2014, Solid Waste Services will deliver to your household the carts you selected in our June 2013 mail out.</p>
      <p>All single-family dwellings and registered suites will receive a standard sized 120-litre organics recycling cart and a standard sized 180-litre garbage cart <strong>unless</strong> smaller, larger or additional carts were selected.</p>
      <p>If the cart sizes you received are not to your satisfaction, they can be exchanged for different sizes for three months once the program starts. After the three months, a cart exchange administrative fee of $50 will be applied.</p>
      <h2>        <strong>Cart Details</strong></h2>
      <p>        All carts have attached lids and large wheels that are easy to move even when full over a variety of surface and grade conditions. Households with long driveways may wish to store their carts outdoors near the end of their driveways year-round. In fact, many households already have small outdoor enclosures for existing containers. Alternatively, residents who currently use their vehicles to transport their carts to the road on collection day will likely be able to continue to do so with the new carts.</p>
      <p>For residents with mobility challenges, curbside collection assistance programs will be provided. Residents can apply for the assistance program in June 2013 as part of the cart selection process.</p>
      <h2><strong>Cart Dimensions</strong></h2>
      <p>If you are building an enclosure for your new carts, or are making space for them, here are the  dimensions:</p>
      <h2><img src="images/cartsizedimensions_001.png" width="619" height="257" alt="cartsizedimensions"></h2>
      <h2><strong>What about animals?</strong></h2>
      <p>        If you are concerned about animals getting into your carts, they have a large wheel base so they cannot be easily pushed over and include tight fitting lids. The organics recycling cart includes an animal-proof latch as well. You were already putting kitchen scraps outside in your garbage, now you&rsquo;ll just be putting them in a different cart. </p>
      <h2><strong>Can I continue to use my existing garbage can(s)?</strong></h2>
      <p>No. Old cans and containers will not work with our new automated collection service. The standardized carts provided are compatible with collection vehicles equipped with mechanical arms that lift and empty carts.</p>
      <h2><strong>Recycling Your Old Waste Containers</strong></h2>
      <p>        Please re-use or recycle your existing garbage cans. Disinfect them and use them for storing emergency supplies or collecting rainwater for your garden. You can also bring them to the Public Works Yard for recycling. Information on recycling dates/times will be provided to households and posted.</p>
      <h2><strong>Caring for Your Carts</strong></h2>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">Each cart will be clearly marked as belonging to the District of Saanich and registered to each property address by serial number and electronic tag. After initial distribution is complete, Solid Waste Services will provide ongoing management and maintenance of the carts which will include delivery of new, additional or replacement carts and repairs to damaged carts.</p>
      <p><img src="images/PropertyOwnersareresponsibleforbox.jpg" width="355" height="167" alt="Property Owner Responsibilities"></p>
      <h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>When and where will the carts be delivered?</strong></h2>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">Carts will be delivered to household front property lines in Spring 2014.</p>
      <h2><strong>What is being delivered?</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All single-family dwellings and registered suites will receive a standard sized 120-litre organics recycling cart and a standard sized 180-litre garbage cart <strong>unless</strong> smaller, larger or additional carts are selected.</li>
        <li>With your new carts you'll receive a kitchen container for daily collection of kitchen scraps, a supply of compostable bags and a user guide which outlines the expanded collection program, curbside cart placement and recycling tips.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><strong>If I move, do I take the carts with me?</strong></h2>
      <p>        No. The carts are the property of Saanich and will be assigned to each property address. A serial number and electronic identification tag identifies the cart and property to which it belongs. If you move, do not take the carts with you. The carts need to remain with the property for the next resident.</p>
      <h2><strong>What happens if my carts get damaged, lost or stolen?</strong></h2>
      <p>        Contact Solid Waste Services staff should your carts need to be repaired or replaced. The carts have an extensive warranty and Saanich will take care of any warranty repairs. Households are responsible for cart replacement costs for carts damaged beyond repair and warranty.</p>
      <p>If carts are lost or stolen, staff will attempt to recover them through their serial number and electronic tag. If the carts cannot be recovered, households are responsible for their cart replacement costs. </p>
