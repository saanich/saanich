      <p><img src="/images/misc/checkmark.jpg" alt="" width="19" height="18" /><strong>Empty your kitchen container frequently.</strong><br>
        Place kitchen scraps immediately into your kitchen container and use compostable bag liners. Do not leave kitchen scraps exposed, as this will encourage flies and wasps.</p>
      <p><img src="/images/misc/checkmark.jpg" alt="" width="19" height="18" /><strong>Keep the lid of your kitchen container and kitchen scraps recycling cart tightly closed. </strong><br>
        This will help prevent insects from being attracted by food waste.</p>
      <p><img src="/images/misc/checkmark.jpg" alt="" width="19" height="18" /><strong>Have your kitchen scraps recycling cart emptied  every collection day &ndash; even if it&rsquo;s not full. </strong><br>
        This will ensure you have enough space in your cart and help reduce odours.</p>
      <p><img src="/images/misc/checkmark.jpg" alt="" width="19" height="18" /><strong>Store your cart in a shady area. </strong><br>
        Warmer weather can increase odour problems. Keeping carts out of the sun will reduce this effect.</p>
      <p><img src="/images/misc/checkmark.jpg" alt="" width="19" height="18" /><strong>Use compostable bags or paper to line the bottom of your kitchen container and kitchen scraps recycling cart. </strong><br>
        This will help mitigate odours, fruit flies, leakage and keep your container and cart clean. An alternative would be to line your container and cart with newspaper, paper bags or paper towels. Remember that soiled paper products (towels, plates, napkins, cups, etc.) can also be added to your kitchen scraps recycling.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><img src="/images/misc/checkmark.jpg" alt="" width="19" height="18" /><strong>Freeze meat and fish scraps until your collection day. </strong><br>
        This will limit odour problems and reduce the risk of insects in your cart. Store meat and bones (protein sources) in your freezer until collection day (they could be further wrapped in newspaper before being put into the kitchen container or cart).</p>
      <p><img src="/images/misc/checkmark.jpg" alt="" width="19" height="18" /><strong>Rinse your kitchen container and kitchen scraps recycling cart frequently.</strong> <br>
        Regular cleaning with vinegar and hot water or a mild biodegradable detergent is especially important during warmer months. Clean residue off the rim and outside of your cart as well. Fly eggs and maggots can be killed by using boiling water or sprinkling them with vinegar.</p>
      <p><img src="/images/misc/checkmark.jpg" alt="" width="19" height="18" /><strong>Keep odours at a minimum the natural way. </strong> <br>
        Sprinkle a small amount of baking soda, garden lime, biodegradable laundry detergent, or vinegar in your kitchen container and kitchen scraps recycling cart as a deodorizer.</p>
      <p><img src="/images/misc/checkmark.jpg" alt="" width="19" height="18" /><strong>Continue to use your backyard compost bin. </strong><br>
        Your backyard compost bin is the most cost effective and environmentally friendly way to dispose of food waste. Use the kitchen scraps recycling pilot project for &ldquo;other&rdquo; organic materials such as meat, bones, fish and bread.</p>
