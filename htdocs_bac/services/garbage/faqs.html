      <h1><strong>GENERAL</strong></h1>
      <h2>        <strong><a name="howwilltheggcswork"></a>How will Greener Garbage Collection work?</strong></h2>
      <p>      Starting Spring 2014, households will receive new wheeled carts for garbage and organics recycling (kitchen scraps and yard trimmings). To help us meet the food waste ban at the Hartland landfill, households will be asked to place kitchen scraps (cooked and uncooked foods including meat and dairy) and food-soiled paper products into an organics recycling cart which will be collected and taken to a facility where they are turned into compost. A great new feature of Greener Garbage Collection is that yard trimmings can be added to the organics recycling cart too.</p>
      <p>The wheeled carts being provided will make it easy for households to place their carts curbside on collection day as we are moving to automated curbside collection where standardized carts will be emptied from the curb using a mechanical arm on a truck, instead of collectors going into backyards to retrieve, lift and empty cans by hand. </p>
      <p>By providing a service that is easy and convenient, we can keep kitchen scraps out of the landfill and make our community cleaner, greener and more sustainable.</p>
      <h2><strong><a name="Whenwillstart"></a>When will organics recycling and curbside collection start?</strong></h2>
      <p>Organics recycling and curbside collection will be phased in throughout the municipality in Spring 2014.</p>
      <h2><strong><a name="Whyrecyclekitchen"></a>Why recycle kitchen scraps?</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To meet the region&rsquo;s waste diversion goals, the CRD will be phasing out organic waste at the Hartland landfill, with a <a href="http://www.crd.bc.ca/waste/organics/kitchen-scraps.htm">full ban on kitchen scraps</a> effective January 1, 2015.</li>
        <li>Recycling kitchen scraps is the single most effective thing we can do for the environment. Kitchen scraps are the largest single item in our waste stream â€“ making up more than 30% of what we throw away.</li>
        <li>Kitchen scraps recycling reduces our garbage and greenhouse gas emissions, extends the life of the Hartland landfill and turns a valuable resource into a useful product.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="urgent"><img src="images/garbageincludesfulllist_002.png" width="682" height="294" alt="garbageincludes"></p>
      <h2><strong><a name="Whatgoesinmycrdbluebox"></a>What goes in my CRD blue box and will the CRD blue box recycling program change?</strong></h2>
      <p>The CRD blue box recycling program will continue on an every second week basis. Clean paper, cardboard, metal, glass, rigid plastic containers and rigid plastic packaging all go in your <a href="documents/WhatgoesintheCRDBlueBox.pdf">CRD blue box</a> for collection. For collection schedules and recycling information contact the CRD Recycling Hotline at 250.360.303 or <a href="http://www.crd.bc.ca/recycle">www.crd.bc.ca/recycle</a>. </p>
      <h2><strong><a name="Ialreadycompost"></a>I already compost at home; why do I need kitchen scraps collection?</strong></h2>
      <p>If you have a backyard compost, please continue to use it as it is the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly way to dispose of food waste.<strong> Kitchen scraps recycling complements</strong> backyard composting by accepting a wider range of food waste that may not be suitable for backyard composting such as cooked food, meat, bones, fish, baked goods, food soiled paper products including paper towels and napkins and paper food-soiled packaging such as used paper cups and paper plates.</p>
      <h2><strong><a name="Ihaveagarburator"></a>I have a garburator; why is it better to use the organics recycling cart instead?</strong></h2>
      <p>If you&rsquo;ve been using a garburator, now you can put your kitchen scraps to good use by placing them in your organics recycling cart instead. It&rsquo;s easy, creates compost and saves wear and tear on your pipes and plumbing too! </p>
      <h2><strong><a name="Whathappensto"></a>What happens to the kitchen scraps and yard trimmings that are collected?</strong></h2>
      <p>Instead of becoming waste at the landfill, kitchen scraps, food-soiled paper and yard trimmings will be taken to a processing facility where they are turned into compost.</p>
      <h2><strong><a name="Isfoodandyardmaterial"></a>Is food and yard material in the landfill really a bad thing? Doesn&rsquo;t this material break down into compost or soil anyways?</strong></h2>
      <p>Food and yard waste does not break down into compost or soil in the landfill because it needs oxygen to decompose. When this material is placed in the landfill, it gets mixed up with other garbage and is quickly buried and compacted.</p>
      <p>Often the garbage stays in an airless environment, and very slowly breaks down. This process can take decades. As it slowly breaks down, the food and yard materials release significant amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.</p>
      <h2><strong><a name="Willkitchenscrapsrecycling"></a>Will kitchen scraps recycling make a difference?</strong></h2>
      <p>12,000 tonnes of garbage is collected from Saanich residents every year and taken to the Hartland landfill. It is estimated 30% of this garbage could be diverted through kitchen scraps recycling. </p>
      <p>In three months, 583 households who participated in the Kitchen Scraps Recycling Pilot Project diverted 19 tonnes of waste from the landfill and reduced their garbage by 37%.</p>
      <h1><strong>COST</strong></h1>
      <h2><strong><a name="Howmuchcost"></a>How much will the service cost?</strong></h2>
      <p>Most households will see their collection costs remain about the same, depending on the cart sizes they choose. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>In 2013, Saanich garbage collection customers will pay $156 for solid waste services; this appears as a separate line item on property taxes. In 2014, this will be replaced with property owners paying an annual base fee of $105 for solid waste services plus an annual cart fee for their garbage and organics recycling carts. </p>
      <p>The carts are not being rented. The cart fees being charged cover the ongoing costs for disposal and processing of garbage and organics recycling collected in the carts at the Hartland landfill and compost facility.</p>
      <p> Additional carts will be available to single and multi-family households for an additional cart fee. Saanich will maintain its current sticker and special pick-up programs.</p>
      <p>Most households will find the standard sized 120-litre organics recycling  and  180-litre garbage carts suitable.  Cart size selections and fees are listed below.</p>
      <p><img src="images/CartCostTableforwebandcartphoto_003.png" width="960" height="363" alt="Carts"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2><strong><a name="IfIhavelesspayless"></a>If I have less garbage, can I pay less? How will this work? </strong></h2>
      <p>To provide incentives for waste diversion, Greener Garbage Collection offers you the flexibility to choose the size of garbage and organics recycling carts that work best for your household. </p>
      <h2><strong><a name="CanIoptout"></a>Can I opt out of Greener Garbage Collection?</strong></h2>
      <p>The CRD will be phasing out organic waste at the Hartland landfill, with a full ban on kitchen scraps effective January 1, 2015. </p>
      <p>To help us meet the food waste ban, Saanich will be providing organics recycling and garbage collection to households starting Spring 2014. If you receive garbage collection services from the District of Saanich, you have been included in the Greener Garbage Collection program starting Spring 2014.</p>
      <p>Saanich will not be able to collect and dispose of  household garbage if it contains kitchen scraps, food leftovers and soiled paper products. </p>
      <h2><strong><a name="Iliveinmulti"></a>I live in a multi-family property: can I participate in the program?</strong></h2>
      <p>All registered suites and dwellings on properties that currently receive garbage collection service from Saanich will automatically be included in Greener Garbage Collection.</p>
      <p>Property managers and strata owners are encouraged to contact Solid Waste Services  at <a href="mailto:greenergarbage@saanich.ca">greenergarbage@saanich.ca</a> or 250-475-5533 to discuss space saver options that would offer fewer, but larger carts for storage in a common area. </p>
      <h2><strong><a name="Willgardenrecycling"></a>Will the Garden Recycling Drop-off and Leaf Collection Program continue?</strong></h2>
      <p>Yes. The Garden Recycling Drop-off site at the Public Works Yard will remain open to Saanich residents and the leaf collection program will continue to be provided every fall.</p>
      <h1><strong>CURBSIDE COLLECTION SERVICE</strong></h1>
      <h2><strong><a name="Whyissaanichchanging"></a>Why is Saanich changing to curbside collection?</strong></h2>
      <p>To collect garbage and organics recycling efficiently and control costs, we are changing to  automated curbside collection, where standardized collection carts are emptied from the curb using a mechanical arm on a truck, instead of collectors going into backyards to retrieve, lift and empty cans by hand. The carts provided to households for automated collection will make handling easy for everyone and trucks can service more homes each day.</p>
      <h2><strong><a name="Willmycollectionschedule"></a>Will my collection schedule change?</strong></h2>
      <p>Garbage and organics recycling will be collected on the same day every second week. New collection schedules for 2014 will be available this fall and households will be notified when curbside organics recycling and garbage collection service starts in Spring 2014. </p>
      <h2><strong><a name="Willmycrdblue"></a>Will my CRD blue box recycling program change?</strong></h2>
      <p>No, the CRD recycling program will continue on an every second week basis <a href="http://www.crd.bc.ca/recycle">www.crd.bc.ca/recycle</a>. </p>
      <h2><strong><a name="WheredoIplace"></a>Where do I place my carts?</strong></h2>
      <p>On collection day, households will be asked to place their carts at the curb or in the mouth of driveways, oriented so the lids open toward the street, ensuring they do not impede sidewalks, traffic or bicycle lanes. </p>
      <h2><strong><a name="Whatiftrees"></a>What if trees, cars or poles interfere with cart pickup?</strong></h2>
      <p>Households will be asked to place carts 1 meter (3 feet) apart and at least 1 meter (3 feet) away from trees, parked cars and other objects like power poles to avoid potential damage to private property and collection equipment. </p>
      <h2><strong><a name="Ihavealong"></a>I have a long driveway, how will I get my carts to the road?</strong></h2>
      <p>The carts are designed to be easy to move even when full over a variety of surface and grade conditions. Households with long driveways may wish to store their carts outdoors near the end of their driveways year-round. In fact, many households already have small outdoor enclosures for existing containers. Alternatively, residents who currently use their vehicles to transport their carts to the road on collection day will likely be able to continue to do so with the new carts. </p>
      <h2><strong><a name="Areassistanceprograms"></a>Are assistance programs available for residents not able to take their carts to the curb on collection day?</strong></h2>
      <p>The carts being provided are designed for easy mobility with large wheels under a stable base to accommodate manoeuvring in difficult weather, surface and grade conditions. </p>
      <p>Curbside collection assistance programs will be provided to residents with temporary or permanent mobility challenges who do not have someone to take their carts to the curb for them and if there is no able-bodied person over 18 years of age living in the residence. Documentation from a health care provider may be requested. </p>
      <p>Staff will work directly with residents to ensure their needs are addressed and a satisfactory level of collection service is provided at no additional cost..</p>
      <p>Residents can apply for the assistance program in June 2013 as part of the cart selection process.</p>
      <h1><strong>ORGANICS RECYCLING AND GARBAGE CARTS </strong></h1>
      <h2><strong><a name="Whyareweprovidingcarts"></a>Why are we providing carts to households?</strong></h2>
      <p>The standardized carts provided are compatible with automated collection where collection vehicles equipped with mechanical arms lift and empty carts into collection vehicles.</p>
      <h2><strong><a name="Howmanycarts"></a>How many carts will I receive?</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All single-family dwellings and registered suites will receive a standard sized 120-litre organics recycling cart and a standard sized 180-litre garbage cart <strong>unless</strong> smaller, larger or additional carts are selected.</li>
        <li>With the new carts all households will receive a kitchen container for daily collection of kitchen scraps, a supply of compostable bags and  information on curbside cart placement and recycling tips.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><strong><a name="Whatarecartdimensions"></a>What are the dimensions of the carts?</strong></h2>
      <p>If you are building an enclosure for your new carts, or are making space for them, here are the dimensions:</p>
      <p><img src="images/cartsizedimensions_002.png" width="619" height="257" alt="cartsizedimensions"></p>
      <h2><strong><a name="CanIexchangemycartsfordifferentsizes"></a>Can I exchange my carts for a different sizes?</strong></h2>
      <p>If the cart sizes you received are not to your satisfaction, they can be exchanged for different sizes for three months once the program starts. After the three months, a cart exchange administrative fee of $50 will be applied.</p>
      <h2><strong><a name="CanIuseoldcans"></a>Can I continue to use my existing garbage can(s)?</strong></h2>
      <p>No. Old cans and containers will not work with our new automated collection service. The standardized carts provided are compatible with collection vehicles equipped with mechanical arms that lift and empty carts.</p>
      <h2><strong><a name="WhatcanIdowitholdcans"></a>What can I do with my existing garbage can(s)?</strong></h2>
      <p>Please re-use or recycle your existing garbage cans. Disinfect them and use them for storing emergency supplies or collect rainwater for garden watering. You will also be able to bring them to the Public Works Yard for recycling.  Information on recycling dates/times will be provided to households and posted.</p>
      <h2><strong><a name="Whatboutanimals"></a>What about animals?</strong></h2>
      <p>If you are concerned about animals getting into your carts, they have a large wheelbase so they cannot be easily pushed over and include tight fitting lids. The organics recycling cart includes an animal-proof latch as well. You were already putting kitchen scraps outside in your garbage, now you&rsquo;ll just putting them in a different cart. </p>
      <h2><strong><a name="IfImove"></a>If I move, do I take the carts with me?</strong></h2>
      <p>No. The carts are the property of Saanich and will be assigned to each property. A serial number and electronic tag identifies the cart and property to which it belongs. The carts need to remain with the property for the next resident.</p>
      <h2><strong><a name="Whathappenscartdamage"></a>What happens if my carts get damaged, lost or stolen?</strong></h2>
      <p>Contact Solid Waste Services should your carts need to be repaired or replaced. The carts have an extended warranty and Saanich will take care of any warranty repairs. Households are responsible for cart replacement costs for carts damaged beyond their repair warranty.</p>
      <p>If carts are lost or stolen, staff will attempt to recover them through their serial number and electronic tag. If the carts cannot be recovered, households are responsible for cart replacement costs.&nbsp; </p>
      <h2><strong><a name="Whenwherecartsdelivered"></a>When and where will the carts be delivered?</strong></h2>
      <p>Carts will be delivered to households in Spring 2014.</p>
