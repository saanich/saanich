      <p>The Legislative Division  is charged with administering the <em>Freedom of Information and
        Protection of Privacy Act</em>. The Act applies to all records in the custody or under the control
        of public bodies like Saanich. The Act gives the public a right of access to Saanich's records
        although there are limited exceptions to that right. The Act also regulates how Saanich collects,
        uses and discloses a wide range of personal information in fulfilling its statutory
        responsibilities and operating its programs. </p>
      <h2>Routine Requests</h2>
      <p> Saanich has always prided itself on being an open Municipality and one that readily shares its
        records with the public. As a result of this philosophy, most of the information sought by the
        public has always been available and is handled informally without using the Act.  Front line
        staff will readily release records such as agendas, minutes, bylaws, policies and procedures and
        information related to your property. </p>
      <h2>Formal Requests</h2>
      <p> Formal requests under the Act are dealt with by the Information and Privacy Team of the Legislative Division and the decision on whether to
        release information rests with the Head of Information and Privacy.  A formal request is a request
        in writing for records that are not routinely available. </p>
      <h2>How to File a Formal Request</h2>
      <p> If you know a formal request is required, an access to information form should be filled out. The
        request should provide sufficient detail to assist staff in locating and retrieving the records.
        To find out if a formal request is required, contact the office directly at (250) 475-1775. We
        also <a href="pdf/foi_form.pdf" target="_blank">have the form</a> <img
                  		src="/images/logos/pdf.gif" alt=""> available as a PDF file. </p>

      <h2>Fees</h2>
      <p> The Act provides for the Municipality to charge a fee for certain limited costs of providing applicants with records. If there are costs involved in processing a formal request, the applicant will be provided with an estimate before the application is fully processed. </p>
