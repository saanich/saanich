		  <h2>Leadership Team </h2>
          <p> <img src="../../images/colin-doyle-thumb.jpg" class="float-right" alt="Colin Doyle">Colin joined the Saanich team in 1990 as a Transportation Design Engineer. He assumed the position of Manager of Transportation in 1996 and was later appointed Manager of Transportation and Infrastructure Planning in 2000. When the Director of Engineering retired in 2005, Colin applied for and was promoted to his current position. </p>
          <p>With truly local roots, Colin was born in Saanich and attended Reynolds High School. After graduating he worked for BC Tel for 6 months, until his desire to see the country led him on a hitch hiking trip across Canada. On his return route back to the coast he stopped (or as he says, &ldquo;got stuck&rdquo;) in Alberta, working full time and taking night courses in Engineering. </p>
          <p>After four Alberta winters Colin returned to the west coast to pursue full-time graduate studies in Civil Engineering at UBC, where he graduated in 1985. He took a position&nbsp;with the consulting engineering firm Graeme and Murray Consultants (now Stantec) where he worked&nbsp;on a variety of projects including&nbsp;designing&nbsp;major portions of the Coquihalla highway, several large projects for the Ministry of Transportation (Highway 16&nbsp;in New Hazleton, Highway 1/Nicole Street in Nanaimo,&nbsp;Highway 97 in Vernon) and the Canadian Coast Guard (Helicopter base facilities in Prince Rupert and Queen Charlotte Islands). </p>
Colin is actively involved in several professional organizations including the American Public&nbsp;Works Association, where he is a founding&nbsp;member of the Center for Sustainability Leadership Group,&nbsp;and Engineers Without Borders. </div>
