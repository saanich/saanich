      <h2>Employee Testimonials </h2>
      <p><img src="../../images/david_mcara.jpg" alt="" class="float-right">When Dave came to work at Saanich, he thought he was going to spend his summer working in refuse collection, but he never left. He worked for six years as an auxiliary employee until a full-time position became available. It&rsquo;s a good thing he persevered. A chef by trade (Dave was involved in the opening of the Toad in the Hole restaurant a number of years ago), and having earned a living as a working musician until he was 28 years old, he says Public Works isn&rsquo;t often a career choice for people. But once they find themselves working there, they discover that it&rsquo;s rewarding and full of opportunity. </p>
      <p>Opportunity presented itself in the form of acting foreman roles for Dave, and in those experiences he found his chef&rsquo;s training provided him with valuable transferrable supervisory and leadership skills. After three years in his full-time position he became the Superintendent of Refuse. Next year will be Dave&rsquo;s 25-year anniversary working at Saanich, the last 12 years in the dual role of Manger of Solid Waste Services and Fleet Centre.</p>
      <p>What does Dave like most about working at Saanich? &ldquo;I find it a healthy work environment. I enjoy the people, and the engaging nature of the work. Daily challenges keep me grounded in the operational work, so I never feel tied to my desk. But there is also the financial management and long-term, strategic planning in which we are charting future directions. It really is the best of all worlds.&rdquo;</p>
Dave is a great example of someone who grew a successful career at Saanich from the ground level. So what is his advice to employees? &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter where you are, opportunity doesn&rsquo;t come to you unless you align yourself for it. And even if you have aligned yourself for opportunity, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;re entitled to the next posting that comes along. Other people are doing the same, and there are no guarantees or promises.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s better to be prepared than to look back and say &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d have &hellip;&rdquo;. This is a 50-50 venture. Have foresight and make yourself a strong candidate.&rdquo;<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
